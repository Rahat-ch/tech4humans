Rahat Chowdhury  0:15  
Hi, I'm Rahat. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  0:17  
Hi I'm Hasibul 

Rahat Chowdhury  0:18  
And you're listening to Tech4Humans. 

Welcome to a brand new episode of tech4humans. My name is Rahat and today we've got Giovannie Hernandez with us. Giovannie you take a second to introduce yourself a little bit?

Giovannie Hernandez  0:32  
Hi, my name is Giovannie Hernandez. I'm the development manager for the code cooperative. I'm also a public speaker and a criminal justice reform advocate formally incarcerated myself and just was able to you know, fortunately attend a college program in prison which really changed my life and the direction in which I was going. And ever since being released three and a half years ago, I've just really been working on like nonprofits. So before this, I was at a bail fund serving as a case manager helping get resources for the individuals that we were bailing out on, you know, just being through the system realizing like how many obstacles were really in our way, just like the education I got there made me be able to, like identify these things has made, you know, serving, you know, the people, my people, a mission of mine, and a passion. And so, like, you know, I come to code cooperative for that and I just love our mission. I love you know, Alex's belief that, you know, tech should be more diverse. And if there's so many benefits to tech, you know, the tech industry offers individuals that you know, those who are have been most marginalized and probably need those access to those benefits the most and just like creating pathways for that to happen, um, has just been really, you know, a goal of hers and the goal of the organizations and just you know, I wholeheartedly believe in that mission and you know, I came into this work just like wanting to help her do that.

Rahat Chowdhury  1:57  
That's awesome. No, that's really inspiring story. Can you give us I guess, a bit of a rundown on what code cooperative does overall?

Giovannie Hernandez  2:05  
Um, so what we do is we essentially try to, you know, and it's a very general statement, you know, we create opportunities for individuals who've been impacted by incarceration in the tech industry, right. And what that means is, you know, what we do whatever we can to facilitate, either, you know, people are learning about tech people being able to work in tech people, you know, even the tech industry being open to hiring people who have been incarcerated with criminal backgrounds. And so what we do is we provide lots of free tech aid to people who are formerly incarcerated. We do a mini boot camp, which is 16 weeks free of cost. We provide laptops for those who don't have them, and we cover travel costs. We provide people with Metro cards to get to and from wherever the location that we're holding the program is. Usually it's like a host organization or some set location that we've been able to like either rent out or they just, you know, they are loaning us the space for those 16 weeks. And it's 12 hours a week. We have mentor our mentors, our professional software engineers who volunteer to come and just work with our students and we you know, we go through everything from as we go through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are like the you know, the reading based languages or creating website and students you know, and for fellows for that program and the program by doing group projects, which could be like websites or little app based ideas, you know, solving some problem that identify you know, lots of times we find that the fellows are usually identify problems, problems that directly impact like their communities and tried to solve this past cohort came up with an idea to create sort of like a civil service locator, which would basically be you know, if someone were in distress, right going, whether it be like I'm having a mental health issue or someone you're you saw someone having a mental health issue, you could go on there and locate someone who was As a certified as maybe a violence interrupter, or a counselor who's on basically on call who's like registered, or they're on call, and you can locate them, and they'll come to, you know, come to take, you know, basically handle the situation before escalates into something else. You know, I thought that was just like a really nifty way of just like solving a problem, like, maybe not involving, you know, a Police Department official, you know, maybe not involving the police in the situation that could be handled maybe through a conversation with someone who knows how to handle it, right, somebody from the community, who has relationships with the people. And so that's just like the types of ideas that have come out of this right, that are cultivated from these people. So I'm realizing what they can do once they learn, you know, of the languages and like, how do you know how to make how to create things. Um, so we do that we do one on one mentorships with professional software engineers who are you know, all volunteer and you know, that schedule looks more those schedules are more based on like, you know, those individuals and their schedules, right? They figure out how often they want to meet up, but they, you know, they go through a process in life that is, you know, basically like I even have a mentor because right now, right I'm also a fellow like I came into code cooperative through fellowship I was a 2019 fellow of the program. And then when Alex was, you know, looking to hire someone, she wanted to hire a fellow, do you want to hire someone who was in the program, and I was just all in man the program was too dope for me to not like put my hand into that. Um, and so the one on one, the one on one mentorship are more just, like, you know, helping individuals who sort of transition either transitioning out of like, the fellowship to continue that learning and figuring out like, have some guidance, right, we don't, you know, like, people know how to learn, I believe in the program and like, know how to do these things. But like, it's always great to have sort of someone who has like a field of expertise that sort of guide you through, you know, tech, because a lot of times tech is just really complicated, especially coming into it from maybe not a traditional background, right. Maybe you didn't go to school. First. You for computer science, and so like a lot of it is still a mystery to you, even if you even if you did through go through our program, um, right now what I'm actually been spearheading and working on, and we should have another one in the next couple weeks, our virtual workshops, you know, given the COVID-19 process, we didn't want to, like abandon our community, because it's really a community we really, like close, you know, a lot of the fellows are, you know, from my experience, like, I'm really close to them, right. I mean, I've been in 16 weeks trying to learn something that we can learn. And it's, you know, it's encouraged to be more collaborative to where it then I was encouraged to basically lean on my fellows for help more, just as much as I like leaned on my mentors, right. And so like, we really collaborate in that in that way. There are a lot of the, you know, fellows ended up being my friends. And so, it's great to just have these virtual workshops. When we can see each other we continue to learn to that process, which is like, you know, learning what you know, and building on what we've learned during the fellowship. We had one a couple weeks ago. given by one of our former mentors on basically other functionality, the CSS, what other things you can do with CSS that you don't get you typically don't assume with CSS or you aren't, well, we didn't learn in our, like our foundation CSS class, which was super cool. And the next one we'll have, we have a next one, though, coming up on model view controllers, which which will, um, will serve as a prerequisite for workshop series of three workshops following that one. So we're really just trying to like continue to like serve the community and you know, provide people with opportunities to learn. We're also currently building the agency, which would be like a freelance contractor. agency, where we are we essentially are partnering with organizations who are looking to outsource some of their tech tech needs, um, and then plugging in our fellows and the people who are qualified to do these jobs with these opportunities right there. Paid opportunities during with actual organizations and tech companies. And they're things that you can build your you can build your page, put on your resume and build that out. Right. Um, and establish also staff relationship and establish relationships with these companies. Right. So it's just, we've continued to try to facilitate this contact between these two groups that essentially don't have as much contact as they should be having.

Hasibul Chowdhury  8:26  
You mentioned a lot about the mentorship. I had a question for the mentorships. Do your fellows have access to them after the boot camp? And I know it's very difficult to continue learning once you kind of lose that classroom setting.

Giovannie Hernandez  8:39  
Yeah, no, I mean, absolutely. So, um, we're all like, on the same Slack channel. Right? Like, we're all like, I DM some of our mentors because I have like friendships with them now, right? Like, I'm just gonna like, Hey, how's it going? I hope everything's cool. How's your dog? Because I love dogs and like, so we might be bonded over dogs. And so they're like, hey, how's your dog? I'm so like, it's Really access, um, you do continue to have these access with those people who did you do build relationships with. And if you want to continue to learn, you know, you can navigate that you can negotiate that or you can come to us and seek another mentor. Um, you know, and I want basically, the one on one mentor shirts are less hands on for us and more so like, you know, here are two people who are looking, you know, when someone's looking to mentor for mentee, someone's looking for a mentor, and we connect them, um, you know, and if things work out, then they had, you know, they create a schedule, they create a game plan for how to go through and if there are any, if there are any other needs, that you know, they reach out to us and we facilitate that.

Hasibul Chowdhury  9:42  
How, do you guys scout out mentors or how can someone become a mentor?

Giovannie Hernandez  9:50  
Well, on our site we have or we have a site for volunteers, people who are interested in volunteering. A lot of our mentors come from, you know, word of mouth. So they're friends of other mentors who've mentored and been like, Oh man, I just that was really dope. And their friends are like, you know what I want to I want to try it, I want to look into that. There are a lot of like Alex's, you know, initially there were like a lot of Alex's contacts from the tech industry. She's a former software engineer made it to like a high level in where she was working. And so like, has a lot of contacts has a lot of friends in the tech industry. And so like, at this point, it's just become a matter of like, we have a list of over I'm honestly gonna say roughly 100 or 150 people who've like said like they've interested in volunteering to do some sort of either whether it's to be a mentor, be one on one mentor, provide other sort of support. So there are people really interested in the mentorship and like a lot of it is just word of mouth, just finding out about the program hearing about the great experience that like their friend has had them going in and like wanting to figure out You know, wanting to see what that's like for them, you know, sort of like wanting to explore that.

Rahat Chowdhury  11:05  
Awesome, you mentioned Alex, Alex is the founder, correct?

Giovannie Hernandez  11:09  
Yes, Alex Qin is the founder of the code cooperative. She is a software engineer by profession, and was doing this by herself up until this year, actually, myself and the operations manager, Army, were her first two hires she, she had, so she had been doing this for three years alone not taking a salary. Um, just you know, because she believed in the mission and started with giving just like basic computer classes in computer coding classes at the Fortran society. Um, and then, you know, it just grew from that it grew from the you know, her experience there with the individuals in her seeing like the need for something like this, and she continued to do as she hoped. did three fellowships and now we're actually a team of four now on we have another individuals came over Roberto who has been super integral of helping us build out this agency to get people, you know, actual paid, you know, jobs or actual paid work in the tech industry. So Alex Qin is really the soul of the code cooperative if I might, if I might say she's like, you know, the way she's able to speak about, you know, the code cooperatives mission, you know, because it's Her mission it's, you know, it's hard not to buy into it, you know?

Rahat Chowdhury  12:37  
Yeah. Um, you mentioned earlier as well that you were a 2019 Code Cooperative fellow, can you tell us a little bit about that experience?

Giovannie Hernandez  12:45  
Oh, man, I'm gonna, you know, so I find myself. In my last job. I worked through a bail fund. And last year, New York State passed the bail reform, right. It was something we had been fighting for for years, you know, advocating for people Than it happened, it wasn't the perfect, you know, wasn't the perfect legislation that we would have voted for, but it was better than nothing. Right? You know, it's better than keeping people inside because they were poor and couldn't afford to pay money to get out. And so, but one of the things that had occured with that is, you know, there was less work for our organization. So our organization essentially like downsized and had to let go a lot of a lot of people, myself included, and so I found myself in a place where I was just like, you know, what am I going to do next? You know, like, what's my next job? You know, where do I go from here? And I've always been interested in tech, I started learning code while I was incarcerated, actually. And then just like, thought that it was just an opportune time to sort of get back into it, why not? Right? Um, reached out to a friend of mine, who was a software engineer who I was incarcerated with Ornell Caesar. And he told he's a friend of Alex, he told me about the code cooperitave and to look into it. So, you know, I went on the site. applied I was like hey this looks cool I applied it was free like why not you know I looked into boot camps there are like 15 $20,000 like I can't afford to and can't work So how am I supposed to like afford this and live during that time? So it just seemed like the most convenient thing for someone in my situation I went there a little hesitant not sure what to expect um you know, bunch of people I don't know a lot of you know a lot of us come from like being incarcerated or being or certain traumatic backgrounds where like, trust is a really big you know, trust is a really big thing in the beginning and like I you know, I walk into a space with people I don't know and it's just like you know, I'm not there you know, it's there still a wall so it's like that and for some people and so after like the first two three classes I just found myself like, no longer feeling like there was a wall I'm also really comfortable with the you know, the code operative really does a great job cultivating a space where you can learn right and part of learning especially for individuals who have traumatic backgrounds is being able to feeling like you can be vulnerable enough to learn right to ask questions right to not feel stupid if you don't understand something or have to ask you you know explain that again one more time right like the code cooperative does a great job facilitating that environment where you're not never gonna feel stupid doing if you don't get something the first two or three times right where it's always just like iight bet you know what you don't get it like this let me let me let's see if someone else can explain to you a little bit differently ore lets all just three just tag team this explanation and it was just that thing where I really dug the vibe I really dug it how it was you know? Alot of these people probably would never have been friends before and became like my brother's like they became especially to my group like those are my guys like we were really close and figuring things out and it's just been it became a great time I look forward to Saturday's right I look forward to spending five hours of my Saturday. No no lie from like 11-2 there with these guys right learning to code, my Saturday, right. And like that became a thing. And you know, because I like learning, but learning isn't always easy, right? You know certain things because it'll get in the way. And the code cooperative does a great job of like getting some of those things out of the way so that you can learn

Hasibul Chowdhury  16:18  
What was like your favorite project that you worked on, during your fellowship,

Giovannie Hernandez  16:24  
There was really only one major project. I think, and which was my favorite thing to work on. It was, it was sort of a directory, we were looking for ways to find all the different resources that the code cooperative had found that worked for our class in one place so that other people who came after us could just like access it all in one place and not have to go through, you know, the hours of Google searching that we'd gone through, right. Um, and so we started that and we have like, a base framework for that, um, but never didn't, you know, the fellowship ended didn't persue it, but I you know, I still think that that's a great idea is to have something where like, people Open Source where like people, like the next fellowship can can can add to that and say like, you know what these resources were great for us to, let's, let's add that into that. And that like it just continues to grow and become this thing that works for people, right? In particular people who come from where we come from, right? Like, some some things may be like, just, this is more digestible or something else, and it just works. And so like that was my favorite project was really the only project but it was like something that I thought was a really dope idea.

Rahat Chowdhury  17:30  
Definitely sounds amazing. Oh, going back to another one of the things you mentioned, you said that code cooperative was launching like an agency. Yeah. So could you tell us like kind of how that works, what kind of companies that you're able to work with through there.

Giovannie Hernandez  17:46  
Okay. Um, so we're still in talks with companies. Um, it's looking very promising. I mean, you know, given the COVID-19 thing things are a little bit difficult, but there is there isn't there isn't an automatic notice. Not an automatic like, Oh no, right? We're having conversations with people, we know where it's like, you know, in the near future or even some people are just like, actually, you know, we're we have so much work that, you know, we're constantly looking to outsource this thing like, let's talk about this more. Um, and so we're looking for a lot of like, you know, nonprofit, social justice, we're reaching out to like our partners, the people that we know, but like a lot of nonprofit social justice organizations and tech companies, that's really who we're reaching out to are like nonprofits that may have maybe have like some sort of digital platforms or something that they use and that could use, you know, some sort of assistance or have like little minor projects, whether it's like website building or a data project. So we're really just trying to establish these relationships and get the ball rolling. So that those individuals who are in a community who have reached who are ready for this, right? who are ready to do these jobs can have access to these jobs, right? It's not necessarily easy, especially when you're like, on your own. Right. So it's always better, like, you know, to have people vouching for you or sort of like doing some of the legwork for you. And so that's what we're trying to, like, provide that. That's what the agency is, it's an outlet for individuals who are, ready to work in the industry and like, so to start getting some experience so that, you know, I can build the resume that can lead them to that great job, and like a Google or Facebook or, you know, a Twitter or something, a slack. And so, we've been working, that's the agency at agency, Is this the place where individuals can get paid work, you know, to be able to like, make money with the skills that we're providing them because that's, at the end of the day, you know, we're providing people skills for them so that they'd be able to use them. Right?

Rahat Chowdhury  19:53  
Yeah, that's awesome.

Giovannie Hernandez  19:54  
Right? And opportunities aren't always easy to easy or readily available for people who have been like, marginalized

Rahat Chowdhury  20:02  
A lot of boot camps just kind of like teach you stuff. And then you're kind of like left to go out into the wild. I really love your approach of like, actually trying to get people, you know, in and doing the actual work get paid for it. That's absolutely awesome.

Hasibul Chowdhury  20:17  
Another thing I wanted to add on top of that, you mentioned earlier, about the previous cohort that did the final project, were finding civil servants nearby. I feel like that experience is great. A lot of companies, you know, they mostly hire college students, right? They don't have that background. They don't have a different way of solving problems. So like when you introduce like, Hey, we have people that have a different insight, and probably know about problems you guys don't even know yet. That gives companies opportunities to, you know, tackle new business, or come up with a very creative solution. And that's great that you guys are creating this agency to get people out there.

Giovannie Hernandez  20:57  
Yeah, and you know, it's good. You know, it's like you No, it's not, this isn't a new idea, like we are, it's common sense. Like some, you know, people mostly equiped, you know, to do or provide solutions for some, you know, for some of the problems out there, the ones who are most who are like in the problem were like, really directly impacted by the problem, they know, the most, we know what things are, like, wrong, like, you know, what things might work better. Um, and so like, you know, just to provide individuals who come from this place with this skills to tackle those problems in different ways, right? just creating their own outlet, creating, you know, like, the, you know, the potential for this solution is coming out of a, like programs like this are endless, right? We're just providing, you know, people like and I see it like I was in the class, and I saw people sort of just like, putting together things like, Oh, I could do this with code and then saying, like, Oh, I could do this with code. And I can make this idea that I've had so long manifest, here, like and I just need to figure out how to do that. So now they're like, how do I learn how to do this? You know, they're asking their mentors like you know, outside of the classroom curriculum like how do I learn how to do this too though? Um, and you know and just seeing that just seeing like their imagination go when they're realizing like you know, do you know anything you know, do you know there's a certain understanding in like how you know in coding or just like how can you know what you can do with it? And then you're like, Oh, I can do this with it. That means I can definitely do this I just have to figure out how to do it

Rahat Chowdhury  22:28  
So um, for someone who wants to I guess apply to the program what's kind of like your admissions process like how can they join a future cohort

Giovannie Hernandez  22:38  
Oh, admissions is super easy you you apply through the site. You have like a little Google Form asks you a few questions basic information, ask a bit you know, a bit about like incarceration not necessary like details about your incarceration. We don't ask like crime or anything. We just like you know, or even incarcerated or or directly impacted by the criminal justice system in any way. And that could be anything that you've been on probation. Um, you know that you know, we really try it we're not we're trying we're not trying to necessarily draw a line we're like you qualified you don't qualify you know, we believe that like incarceration impacts a lot of people in a lot of different ways, right mass incarceration has impacted so many people and not necessarily directly maybe you have been incarcerated maybe your your your father has been incarcerated and like, you know, your experience is much different, right? Because of that because like, you have to like have gone to prison to visit him you've had to been on the bus trips you know, you have to like your relationships your father maybe through letters and through like  phone calls rather than like in person and like, that's a very unique experience for you. Um, you know, I speak to that because I know my dad did nine years when I was a kid, and like, you know, in Florida it's like all I had were, you know, letters every couple months. If that. Um, so like, you just apply online, you know, to be a simple Google Form, you'll have a following that you'll be reached out for a phone interviews just a really quick interview we don't you know, we're not asking you about like, Oh, can you code it you know, we we assume no tech background Oh no, tech experience and we just you know, we're just basically just want to have a conversation to ask some questions you know, the time would you be able to make make it on Saturdays from this time to this time because because that's what the classes are and the other you know what I mean? And then following that you have an in person interview. And so like our last cohort where it started at about 18 people, and we finished with about when we finished with 14 and a couple people who because of personal problems and things just like had to drop out of the program. But we finished with a strong 14 people and it was a great set. We celebrated it we have like a showcases and a year to present their projects. We had like a little talent portion. We have, you know, some talented individuals who might, you know, a pianist, we have a really talented rapper, a poet, like it was really dope. It was just a fun time great experience, you know, a fun celebration of just like people's hard work after 16 weeks.

Hasibul Chowdhury  25:10  
Is there a specific curriculum you have set up for the fellowships? Or because you mentioned you already assume someone has no coding background? Yeah, what do you guys do to get them up to speed?

Giovannie Hernandez  25:20  
So no, we just start from the basics like the very first class is like an explanation of like, what is code? Like we start off with easily just like we're in that conversation of what is code to demystify right, like people understand code as like the matrix you know what I mean? That its coming you know, all those numbers and stuff coming down and like for and I get that right I was there one time like, I was like, shit code sounds like some super like making a computer work. do things like that sounds super complicated for someone who doesn't understand the concept. So we start with we start with that conversation of what is code and build out from that you know, into like basic like your first you know, like, Hello World page, right, your first like, message And we go through this curriculum of like, doing HTML, CSS, and then building into like a little bit of JavaScript, but and having like workshops in the middle that have like different things. Um, you know, the workshops definitely build on these ideas that we're working on. that are you know, and these workshops are not through presentations, as you call them, presentations, not so much workshops are put together by our mentors, right, limited as each week. So a mentor will present something on, you know, what, we're, what we're studying for that class, right? And then we'll spend the rest of the class sort of going through it in our individual groups, with our mentor. So like, and like that last class, I had three mentors in my group of like four or five people, right, like the three to five mentors, like that ratio was like the amount of help that we were getting, like, you could basically get individualized attention the entire time. Right? It's like, so it's like you can like it's really, you're not you're not there for self right? We're not sink or swim, you get your support and people are there to help you. And we're making sure of that.

Rahat Chowdhury  27:12  
You mentioned like you had a lot of different mentors in your cohort. Like how many mentors are usually assigned to like a full cohort?

Giovannie Hernandez  27:22  
We had about 10 mentors, for 14 people for 18 people. That's amazing, right? We had exactly 10 mentors and I think one we had one mentor, like, toward the end of the end of the program, because of personal reasons had to leave but like 10 mentors like for most of the program for you know, 18 people is like, tons of support like so. You know, there it I don't know, I love the experience. I loved having like, all my mentors were super dope. They're super cool people, like you're very different and in very unique ways, but just like, made my experience so the more and more are the more fun and just like I got, you know, different There's almost like the same thing sometimes. Which really helped, right? Like, having like different explanations to like, one explanation didn't work for me. Someone else could come and be like, how about how about this? And I'm like, Oh, that makes sense. You know, I'm saying and having access to those different perspectives is really great. The vast knowledge.

Rahat Chowdhury  28:17  
What are some ways I guess people can contribute aside from becoming a mentor?

Giovannie Hernandez  28:22  
Oh, well, as always, we're a nonprofit, you could donate. donate money through our site. You could donate a laptop, we're always taking on laptops, preferably Mac books, because it's just easier to have everyone we saw like, like macs we have in stock and it's just easier if everyone works on the same type of computer. But, yeah, donating laptops if like you or maybe your tech department has laptops in like the closet somewhere that the interns maybe use one time and like, they're gathering dust in the closet as most tech companies do, you know? We're always glad to take them on. We gift our laptops to our individuals at the end of the program, right are not the people you know, it makes no sense that we give you the skills loan you the laptop for the duration of program to build these skills and then like say, Hey, can we have our laptops back? And like, you don't actually have your own? Right? It's just like how, you know, how am I going to continue this right? And so we gift our laptops to our fellows at the end of the program, as sort of it's like a thank you and like, you know, so they can continue to engage and continue to grow and continue to learn. Um, and so you can donate that and word of mouth, you can speak to your friends, you can, you know, a repost, follow us, you know, just like really, anything you can do to sort of like, spread the word about the code operative. You know, inform people about what we do. Or just always donate or just donate money doesn't always have to be you know, time or your laptops anything actually anything helps.

Rahat Chowdhury  30:00  
We usually like to wrap up with like a catch up session. What have you been up to outside of code cooperative or what would you have liked to do if we weren't stuck inside?

Giovannie Hernandez  30:10  
Oh, well, um, so I'm continuing to learn so I actually enrolled in Columbia has has the Center for Justice has justice through code Bootcamp, which is Python and data analysis. I've been doing that since February and like, you know, it was in person that started in person and like, we just moved virtually and so like, we're, we're in the at the end of that, where I'm working on my final project for that. I'm following which I'm also working on applying to Hack Reactor Next Chapter program, which is a scholarship program where they will pay for you an individual to go through their Hack Reactor boot camp, and then you do a paid on the job apprenticeship at a tech company in San Francisco, but it's based in San Francisco, so you know, I'm hoping to get in there. And I might be relocating. Fortunately, in the future to the west coast for a bit. It's it's about it's a year long program and following which we're, you know, their last cohort, you know, individually, I think was the three people. They were hired on at slack, actually, as software engineers, and junior developers and like build or evolve or like promoted or like, trying to transition to different jobs. And so like, yeah, I'm hoping my goal is to become a software engineer, you know, that's how I got in. That's why I started the code, the code cooperative fellowship and like how now I ended up doing the work. And like, it's, that's still the goal. So I'm working toward that I'm working to become a professional software engineer. Oh, one really, really fun interesting thing that happened was I thought I saw I wound up on Netflix. Like during quarantine. So while incarcerated, I was a subject, one of the subjects of this documentary called the college behind bars, which is about this college program and the college program that I actually attended in prison and which through I got my degree I bought through a Bard College. And so documentary came out last year around November, and that's why I do public speaking, I travel the country and I speak about my experiences and the importance of like access to higher education for everyone. Um, and during this whole thing, somehow, Netflix picked it up and went on Netflix. And so like, it's it's been really interesting to be stuck at home and have a lot of people stuck at home and watching Netflix and so that's been different. That's been interesting. Like it's cool, but it's also just like, I'm glad the reception is i'm i'm glad the reception has been so great and supportive, right people are it's really opening people's eyes to the experience and says to the importance of education for everyone, like how transformative education actually is for individuals and like, why are we denying it to people you know, at such high levels.
