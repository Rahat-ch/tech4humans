Rahat Chowdhury  0:15  
Hi, I'm Rahat. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  0:17  
Hi I'm Hasibul. 

Rahat Chowdhury  0:18  
And you're listening to tech4humans. Welcome to a brand new episode of tech4humans. My name is Rahat. And we've got two awesome guests with us today. Andy and Drew, can you guys Introduce yourself a little bit? Tell us a little bit about what you do.

Andy Pickle  0:32  
Yeah. So I'm Andy Pickle. I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas. I'm the co founder protege and actually a project manager by day. And developer by night.

Drew Clements  0:43  
I'm Drew um, I guess the original founder of protege. Andy jumped on right early. So as I consider us kind of equal founders. I'm, I'm a front end developer.

Rahat Chowdhury  0:55  
Awesome. Can you tell us a little bit about what Protoge is and Yeah, some of the inspiration behind it, why y'all started it?

Drew Clements  1:04  
Um, well, protege is a it's a job board that's catered towards remote opportunities for junior developers. It was really kind of born out of necessity. Because at the beginning of all this COVID mess, I lost both of my jobs. And I kept having the hardest time trying to find places I could apply, or places that were open to juniors. So I already had the domain name for protege. So I figured I had all this newfound time, so I may as well do something with it.

Andy Pickle  1:36  
Yeah, and I kind of jumped in when I saw a tweet. Drew posted that he had just lost both of his jobs. And I was like, I had, you know, similar ideas in the back of my head, nowhere near as well fleshed out and I was like, Oh, I'm, I'm jumping on that can I help. Just just jumped in. And I've been in that same situation as well, where I was junior dev looking for a job, I was working in a startup for a while and it, it wound down. And I just just couldn't really find anything specifically for people of my, you know, skill level, essentially, you know.

Hasibul Chowdhury  2:12  
It sucks that you had to lose your job to start this but you know, I feel like we need a some level of hardship or a kick in the butt to start something great. You know, what else? What other inspirations or what led you to start this, you know, instead of you, you know, looking for something else or getting a temporary job What made you want to do this instead.

Drew Clements  2:34  
Um, for me, I've always, I've only gotten as far as I have in the tech industry, because I've always had someone that was willing to either give me a chance or extend a helping hand. So it's always been in the back of my mind that if I ever get if I'm ever in a position to be able to do the same that I want to, then it just it really just kind of like it really just kind of like lined up, you know, right. Right time. right amount of free time to just kind of go for it.

Andy Pickle  3:04  
Yeah, and I've been kind of active in the, you know, Twitter communities around like hundred days of code, you know, around learning on like Free Code Camp or some of these other places and just seeing so many people who are able and like, just like hungry for jobs, but, but companies that are really struggling, or basically don't seem to be motivated to hire them. And that was kind of a struggle for me, because I'm like, these people can do it, and they're, they're ready. But I want to kind of give them a resource to be able to, you know, jump in somewhere that's ready for them, to help them move into like, you know, a better place in their career.

Drew Clements  3:41  
And there's, there's probably a whole, you know, like, slew of people that consider themselves junior developers that are probably far more advanced than I am and could could probably build this thing 20 times better than I ever could. But because we have this title of junior developers or you know, we don't have the Three to whatever years experience yet companies just aren't willing to hire people and I understand it to an extent in some cases, they may just need someone they can drop in that they can, that can get to work and pick up the ball where the last person dropped it. Um, but I also think there's a, there's a lot of companies out there with the resources that it would take to invest in some of these, you know, extremely talented, extremely driven people and give them the opportunity to really shine and we really just want to, we want to find we want to find the people on both ends of that and have a place where they can find each other.

Hasibul Chowdhury  4:41  
Yeah, that's great. You know, I really like the way you mentioned earlier how you are where you are in your world because people you know, reached out and helped out and it's great that you're paying it forward. For people who are juniors like we're all Junior devs here and Rahat can attest to it wasn't really easy to find a job especially as straight out of bootcamp. I know Rahat went to maybe 100 meetups just trying to like... every week he's like, Okay, I'm going to this meetup. Can you come with me, you know, just to connect, you know, busted our ass just to get his, you know, current job and my current job and this is wonderful. And you mentioned about your skill level. And honestly, I don't think that even matters. Like the website is nice and clean. Right? It's, it's, I feel like it's not what you know, is like, can you actually use those skills? And I feel you show that off on your website.

Drew Clements  5:29  
Yeah. And before before Andy came on, it actually was going to just be kind of like a portfolio filler project. It was I was still gonna build the same thing, but I wasn't really going to try to, to push it or make it a thing. I was just, I was just going to build it and then put it on my portfolio, just to show that I do know how to use react and some of these different technologies. And then Andy came on board and like he looked at the time on the other day, I think it was on like a like a Thursday. He was like, hey, I want to help. And then on like Saturday, he was already shipping code. And then once he came on board and like how like excited and ambitious and tenacious he was with the progress he was making, I was like, Alright, if this dude's going full in I'm, I'm right there with him.

Rahat Chowdhury  6:18  
So you mentioned, Andy, that you're like a project manager, you kind of like project management this too, or how does it like kind of like the division of labor kind of work between you two?

Andy Pickle  6:28  
I mean, I kind of have been trying to not over project manage it, just because I do that all the time. You know, you know, I've been trying to be a little bit more, you know, I can bring detail oriented stuff to this, but truthfully, I'm kind of in a similar situation as Drew where I'm trying to build my portfolio because project management is just not a huge passion of mine. I don't really get a lot of joy out of like telling people what to do as much as like actually putting my fingerprints on things and like doing things myself. And so and I mean, I think there's a time and a place for that, as well. But you know, I probably don't over project manage, if anything, probably under do it compared to my day, my day job.

Drew Clements  7:14  
There's a fair amount of we make it up as we go as well. Like if there's, if it's, if it's an idea he comes up with, and it's like, what, it's actually getting implemented into the project, then, you know, he can he can have his reign over that if there's been a couple things that were my idea that I kind of, like, managed through the process. And then there's, there's a few things that are in the works now that were kind of my idea, but kind of need a larger project management like scoping touch to it that at some point, we need to sit down and actually scope out, but that's going to be more of a collaborative effort. So we make up a lot of it as we go.

Andy Pickle  7:54  
Yeah, with two people it's not too terribly hard to just, you know, tag team all those items.

Hasibul Chowdhury  7:59  
Yeah. Yeah, you mentioned react, you know, what are tools and technology you're using for your website? How are you managing to collaborate between two of you?

Drew Clements  8:11  
So right now the stack is react on the front end we're using Firebase, for the database. We have Formik in there for form handling and validation,

Andy Pickle  8:21  
Tailwind, styling,

Drew Clements  8:23  
tailwind, tailwind, that's it tailwind CSS for the styling, and it really there's been parts I had I had never used Formik before before this project and it was actually recommended from another friend of ours. Um, but again, Andy just kind of like, jumped in headfirst took off running with it.

Andy Pickle  8:47  
I also had not used Formik either. So there's there's a little bit of tutorial watching as you know, as you do and when you jump into a new one, and then the most recent thing that we we shipped was a the cypress testing we just went through in the testing with Cypress

I love Cypress, Cypress Cypress is a lot of fun shout out Cypress!

Rahat Chowdhury  9:13  
One of our previous guests was from Cypress. Definitely awesome company can you tell us a little bit like about how like the testing works with Cypress. I've, as far as testing goes, I've just done like unit integration type tests. What's kind of like the, I guess the advantage of using something like Cypress?

Andy Pickle  9:34  
So the the reason I love Cypress was just that you can watch the test run, you know, visually in like that kind of, like automated test environment. And so instead of just seeing like a list of checkmarks you know, in your in your terminal, you instead see it actually typing in inputs into this form and all that kind of stuff. I loved watching that. So that's kind of my number one and I Don't don't have a ton of experience with testing. So this is my first kind of big foray into it. But I really liked that the docs are pretty top notch for finding what you need. And then I actually just, like put out a Twitter, like call one day, and had one of their dev at advocates had responded to me like in 20 minutes saying, How can I help so you know, like, I mean, it's pretty much all around not not just like the, you know, the, the software itself, but also the fact that they had a literal person reach out to me to try to help, you know, debug things with me. So, all around huge fan of Cypress now.

Drew Clements  10:38  
And even when it comes to writing the test aspect of it, they have it, they have it pretty ironed out where it's a really enjoyable dev experience. Though you're, you're never like jumping through huge hoops to like get a function you're, you're like grabbing, you're grabbing the input you need to type like dot get or dot contains or dot click or something very simple. Very easy to read. And it's really just kind of like a string of commands like that. And that's, that's pretty much all it takes.

Rahat Chowdhury  11:07  
You guys mentioned that you're using tailwind CSS in, like building Protoge. How's that experience kind of been like is I've been trying to wanting to like get into like using some type of CSS framework like that. But I feel like it just clutters up the React code, like adding a whole bunch of these classes and stuff. Have you kind of like dealt with that? 

Drew Clements  11:29  
I love it. I was first exposed to tailwind in November of last year. And it's unless someone gives me a valid reason why I shouldn't that's probably what I'm going to use for the rest of anything. If I have a say in it. It's um, it is a lot. It is a lot in in the HTML or more more than you'd be used to. If you're writing your CSS seperatly or however, you would usually go about it but the way we have Protoge set up is it's pretty fragmented out, or I guess abstracted out into components. So there's, there's never really a whole lot in one file. So it's still kind of easy to parse. But I absolutely love it, I'll, I'll never use anything else.

Andy Pickle  12:12  
Yeah, I'm a, I'm a believer as well, like, it's just the speed with which you can actually make things look the way you want them to look, and then tweak and like small, small little bits. It's just so much easier to me when you're using, like the utility class kind of version of things, as opposed to, you know, altering something back in your CSS file, and then re you know, restarting it or, you know, whatever you do, to kind of refresh that. When you're applying these styles that already exist. You know, it's just like, Oh, I need a little bit more padding, like, throw some padding in there. You know, if I, and, you know, obviously, there are other frameworks out out there that do that. But I feel like tailwind makes more sense to me than say, like bootstrap or something like that where, you know, bootstrap tried to do these things. But they're they're abstractions or what they call their classes. Don't you know they don't make sense to me like in terms of what they're named whereas in tailwind it's always you know, text this font this pad you know padding is always p you know stuff like that it's just very, very clear and very easy to remember most of it and their documentation is top notch. So it's also like really easy to find what you're looking for on top of that. So I'm a I'm a huge believer as well I've used it on I used it on a project before protege and now on protege and then I'm using it on my portfolio as well. So like 100% fan of Tailwind.

Rahat Chowdhury  13:38  
Coming back to I guess protege a little bit so I guess like the main function of it is to be a job board. Do you reach out to companies to like list and things on the job board or do you kind of like, look for opportunities to post there how does that kind of work?

Drew Clements  13:56  
We have a we have a few irons in the fire on the on that end of things. Me and Andy both spend a fair amount of time looking at different job boards, trying to find some that we feel fit protege we one thing I've noticed a lot on LinkedIn is it'll be, it'll be tagged as a entry level position, but then they're asking for six years experience. And we, we really want to avoid situations like that. So any listing on there you either me or him have personally read through the whole thing and made sure that it's going to fit the requirements of the people that are here to find a job and that it's not just someone tagging it as a easy job just so they can, you know, widen their candidate pool. And Andy also has some and he also has some stuff in the works that'll that'd be pretty awesome if they get if they can get worked out.

Andy Pickle  14:48  
Yeah, we've been trying to talk, you know, both to like hiring manager, recruiter type people as well. Today I had a call with a gentleman who runs a boot camp and he was like, Trying to figure out ways for us to, you know, kind of work together on this and, and figure out ways that we can help people get hired because we're really aligned, you know, with a boot camp in that we all want to get people hired into, you know, Junior dev roles, because they're educating them and they've got, you know, you know, basically people have put trust in them and put money with them to tell them get educated, get jobs, and, you know, for us, we just see that this job market is kind of underserved. And so we just want to help people find those. And so, yeah, that would mostly right now, we're, we're getting these manually, like kind of scouring them ourselves. You know, ideally, at some point, we're hoping those jobs will be, you know, kind of coming to us and we still want to curate them and we still want to make sure that they're accurate and, you know, appropriate for the people that we've, you know, niche down to because, like drew was saying earlier, when you click a, you know, a job posting on LinkedIn that says It's for juniors. And then it says, you know, oh yeah, we're actually looking for a principal developer with you know, 100 years experience or whatever. It's so annoying. It's so annoying and we don't want people to waste their time doing that.

Hasibul Chowdhury  16:12  
No, definitely. That's very time consuming, you know, like the fact that you guys are actually going through this and manually approving jobs or can you give me a little more insight of what you're looking for what is okay for you to post on protege? You know, let's say you go down and you find two Junior jobs, why would you post one over the other?

Drew Clements  16:31  
For me, I really look at the I don't go too deep into it. But I take a glance at the culture of the company. And then I just kind of really kind of try to evaluate like, how how they've written the job posting. You can tell when it's when it's a company that's excited about bringing new people into the industry. You know, if you're, if you're new to something, you're excited about it, you're ready to go. You just want to hit the ground running and get work done. And some of these postings you can see that the companies are In some cases, there are startups and have that same mentality and they want to find people. But you know, with that same mindset themselves, and then sometimes you can tell that it was maybe just worded by a hiring manager. And they they put just enough keywords in there to where it could qualify as a junior developer, but they're really looking for a full stack mid does senior position. I think we've looked I know I've looked at hundreds of job listings at this point to at this point, I can just kind of glance and skim through and kind of tell which ones are good and which ones are, you know, really just trying to find the biggest candidate pool out there. But for me, it's it's trying to, I guess I feel most confident about it when I feel like the company culture kind of lines up with the position they're trying to find.

Rahat Chowdhury  17:45  
Definitely, yeah, you mentioned there with like, like something that's listed as a junior but they're looking for like something more mid mid level. Like from my kind of experience of kind of like when I was looking through jobs I felt like and maybe you've come to exclusion as well as like, a lot of companies are kind of like saying Junior, they want the mid level, but they want to pay you as you as if you were a junior. And that's, that's what I kind of get from a lot of these job listings. Is that kind of like something you look out for a little bit or something you're able to tell from some of your listings?

Andy Pickle  18:20  
That's a pretty tough question, honestly. I feel like, you know, you can sometimes I guess, for me as I'm trying to, like parse through a job, you know, a job posting and whether or not it's either, I guess, legitimate, maybe not the right word, but maybe if it's not aligned with kind of what we want to post out there is like, if they're asking for people with five years experience, it's like, no, someone with five years experience is not a junior anymore, you know, if they're, if they're asking for, you know, a front end developer, but they also want you to be able to, you know, you know, right back end code, it's like, well, you actually want a full stack developer. You don't want a front end developer, you know, stuff like that. Like just kind of trying to cut through the BS and realize, you know, obviously every job posting is just trying to get people and a lot of times these postings are not even written by, you know, developers or the person who's doing, you know, a real hiring but maybe by a hiring manager or by another outside firm or something along those lines, right. But, and, and so we got to kind of hold those things intention of like, you know, it's probably not written by the person you'll report to. But we also want to make sure that they're not, you know, posting a senior dev job and trying to pay for a junior Dev, you know, whatever, you know, so we got to kind of just play it by ear and do do the best we can to kind of cut through the crap.

Rahat Chowdhury  19:37  
So besides the job listing I saw like you guys have like learning resources and a few other things. Is there like anywhere is a roadmap for like going to expanding this like beyond being a job board?

Drew Clements  19:52  
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, me and Andy were actually talking about that some today. We have. We have a bunch of ideas and ways. We want to expand this and make this as, as valuable as it can be for those who need it. And some, some of it's just going to come down to, you know, we need to get some of the some of the tech stuff up going first and then we can focus on other parts of it, we really want to, I think what some job boards do is they're there, they're a job board that companies come to because they know they get the traffic. Um, what we, one of the things we were discussing earlier is that we want to be a job board that does get traffic. But we also want to kind of, we want to create and kind of cultivate a community around it. So it's not just, it's not just the thing that just lives on the internet. But, you know, we've talked about maybe implementing a blog, interviewing some people that are looking for jobs, so maybe companies that come there can get a little insight on the type of candidates they're, they're considering when they're posting here, interviewing people on the other side after they have gotten hired. Through the job board. Um, so yeah, there's a lot of ideas of how we want to grow it now it's just down to finding time to make it all happen.

Andy Pickle  21:09  
Yeah, I mean, like, I mean, we kind of say that, like, nothing is super off the table just yet, you know, but, um, you know, essentially, at the end of the day, what we want to do is try to, you know, help people get hired, and help companies find the right people to hire, you know, and so that kind of goal there is just like, how do we bring value to those people. So, you know, if you're, if you're seeking a job, you know, and you're in a junior, you know, type skill level, and you would love for that to be remote. Like, we want to be the place for you to come, come look for a job, and you're going to not have to cut through the crap and all the BS of finding jobs that don't fit. Or at least, you know, finding, you know, you may not know all the tech stack, but you might be more likely to find a job that you want, right? But then for a company, it'd be like, Okay, well, we find somebody who aligns with the values that we have as well you know, with somebody who Doesn't, doesn't care to go to an office or somebody who you know, is able to work in, you know, on their own time, or that you can trust for different reasons as well. And so we're, we're certainly open at this point to being, to like, looking for ways that we can create more value for the both of those people, um, you know, in whatever way. So that's, that's kind of what we're doing. We're not really taking things off the table just yet. Because there might be something interesting that we haven't thought about yet. And we would love feedback on ideas for that. Because, you know, why not give it give us ideas? We love that. We don't think that we have the perfect idea for how to build something like this, you know?

Hasibul Chowdhury  22:40  
Yeah, I just want to ask like, I know, a lot of positions you listed are, you know, Front end or full stack. Have you thought about like hybrid roles? What are your thoughts? Maybe like, I know, I've seen a lot of even my bootcamp grad cohorts they move toward like technical pm roles, or sales engineers. Have you thought about that?

Andy Pickle  23:00  
Yeah, I mean, I, it has definitely crossed my mind a couple times of, you know, there being obviously different roles where it's, you know, yeah, project managers who write code or product managers who write code or you know, you know, maybe customer service people who are able to debug problems that, you know, users are having or whatnot. There are a whole lot more jobs in tech than simply being a developer. You know, I think it's definitely important for at this exact moment for us to stay niche to developers. And so I guess it would be like, if the job is has no development part part of it, then it definitely wouldn't fit. And but uh, but honestly, I mean, yeah, why Why not? If a job is hybrid and you get to write some code, then I don't see why it wouldn't fit, you know, but I haven't personally seen a lot of those as postings yet, but I'd love to see more of them.

Drew Clements  23:53  
And we don't, right now we don't have any plans on the table to expand into you know, project management or team lead or other roles like that. We're not opposed to it. But we we want to make sure we're really serving junior developers very well first. And then once we feel like we have that maybe not mastered but that we're doing a good job at it, then then we'll start considering expanding to the, to the other areas of tech,

Rahat Chowdhury  24:21  
essentially, like your, I guess, your user base or customers would be people looking for their first job, or a junior position somewhere along those lines. So would you ever consider I guess, doing like, kind of the opposite of like, trying to promote Junior devs to companies or just having a listing of like, maybe people who are looking for their first Junior jobs that, you know, companies might be able to go through.

Drew Clements  24:48  
We've had some discussions on on doing that we haven't really pinpointed what that would look like for us. We know there are a bunch of other companies that already do that. Um, and like Andy was saying Earlier there's we're not taking anything off the table yet we just right now we don't really have a definition of what that would look like for us.

Rahat Chowdhury  25:10  
Is there anything else about like protegees out there that you'd want to mention?

Drew Clements  25:13  
One of the things, we do have a mailing list, you can sign up for that at the bottom of the website. We don't really we don't send a whole lot from it. So don't worry, you're not going to get spammed, I think we've sent out two since we've created it. And I felt really bad about sending out those two. I was like, these guys are gonna hate me. They gave me their email, and now I'm using it. So that's their we're, one of the things we'll work we're trying to figure out is kind of like what a schedule for that looks like. So we want to we want to send out maybe a bi weekly newsletter, you know, these are the new jobs, these are the ones available. So you can sign up for that we did just put a couple of issues in our GitHub repo. So one of the things another thing We'll discuss today is that we really want to kind of start trying to cultivate a community around protege. So it's not just a job board, it's there's an entire community around it. Because there's a lot of companies there are only as strong as community around it. And we really want to kind of dig into that, though. We're gonna, there's only two right there. There's only two now. And they're really simple ones, but we're going to try to keep like, we're going to try to keep the issues been full. So for anyone that wants to contribute, can jump on.

Rahat Chowdhury  26:31  
I think that's awesome. Just like, yeah, that's like, you know, job board for juniors. And there's also like that opportunity for juniors kind of like, step in and like, contribute to something. That's definitely an awesome thing to do to just like, have that.

Drew Clements  26:47  
Yeah, and we're also We're also on Twitter. It's dev protege on Twitter. Again, we don't post a whole lot on there. We don't really do much for the marketing. We don't we don't want to be we don't want to be overly markety. Or hey look at us but we do want to help people so we got to an extent we got we've we've got to yell until enough people know we're here and then we can get to work

Rahat Chowdhury  27:12  
so usually like to wrap up with like a kind of a catch up session of like, you know, what are you up to outside of your work with protege dev

Drew Clements  27:23  
so outside of protege I am. I'm working as I just started. This is actually my second weekend I just started a front end developer position with a company called layer frame. That's been really fun. A lot of fun projects. The first project I'm working on is really fun and all the ones they tell me I'm going to be on look just as exciting. Outside of that, I'm a father of a 19 month old little girl. We're about to have a little boy a couple months, so 

Hasibul Chowdhury  27:49  
Congratulations. 

Drew Clements  27:50  
Thank you. It's it's been a real change of pace for me. I went I spent 10 months working two jobs. One full time one part time, so I'd be in the office from nine in the morning till five in the afternoon, then I'd come home and I'd eat dinner, spend some time with my family. And then I'd be back on the computer working remotely from like seven to 11. And then like both of those came to like an abrupt halt at about the same time. So I went from working most of the day to not working at all. So it's been been a little bit of a shock to kind of adjust to that lifestyle. I think definitely the first few weeks I was adjusting to it. I played way more video games and I should have but I'm kind of getting back in back into a routine and the it's been it's been a fun change of pace.

Rahat Chowdhury  28:38  
Yeah, I think definitely just taking a little bit of time to like play video games or just kind of just unwind a little bit is definitely important in between jobs, I think.

Yeah, it was one of the things like I didn't I didn't realize how tired I was while I was, you know, in the grind, I guess because I was working so much I didn't have time to pay attention to it. And then as soon as as soon as I had like nothing but free time I was like, Oh, this is what having the life is like. It's been awesome though even my wife absolutely loves all the all the extra time she gets with me now because I two jobs kind of eats up alot of time. That wasn't a whole lot of time for us. But now, now I'm working remotely working from home I think well its COVID right now, so everyone's working from home, but it's been fun.

Yeah, so my other side project right now is updating my portfolio. So hopefully it will, it will look nice. I know drew gave me some some feedback. And I got some feedback from a couple other designer friends of mine. So I've been working on that, which has been pretty fun. And then obviously, my full time job is I'm a project manager for a design firm, called view we build. We build digital digital products and websites and all sorts of stuff for all sorts of different companies. So that keeps me pretty busy. And then you I have a daughter who's gonna turn four in about a month. So she's, she's wild. She just started loving Star Wars. So that's been super fun for me. We've been having a lot of lightsaber battles. That's been great. And
