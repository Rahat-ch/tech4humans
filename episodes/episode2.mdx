note: In this episode we praise Flatiron School for its work in making sure students feel like they are in an inclusive and safe environment. We hope that Flatiron continues to promote this culture and caring for their students by agreeing to refund the difference of in person versus online bootcamp tuition for all students affected by Covid-19.

Rahat Chowdhury  0:15  
Hey, I'm Rahat.

Hasibul Chowdhury  0:17  
Hi I'm Hasibul and you're listening to tech4humans. 

Rahat Chowdhury  0:21  
Welcome to Tech for humans. This is Rahat. Our guest today is Cecilia. Cecilia, you want to introduce yourself a little bit. Tell us a little about yourself.

Cecilia Martinez  0:30  
Yeah, so I'm Cecilia Martinez. I am in Atlanta, Georgia. I'm a success engineer at Cypress. It's a testing framework for anything that runs in a browser and then testing integration testing, unit testing if you get creative. And I am also here as I am in the leadership team for out in tech Atlanta mine, one of the founding members. So out in tech is a global organization. It's a 501 c three nonprofit that aims to unite the LGBTQIA + community in tech. We do this through a couple different initiatives on the global level, we have our digital core, which essentially helps to provide resources and create websites for organizations and countries where they still face a lot of LGBTQ discrimination, where if it's illegal to be LGBTQ, we also have out in U, which is a mentoring program for queer and questioning youth looking to get into tech, we have scholarships available for people looking to get into tech as well. But probably what we're best known for is the, you know, hundreds of meetups that we host every year throughout our local chapters, in order to essentially provide a safe space for people in the tech industry that are LGBTQIA together and, you know, share resources and also to just kind of enact social change through technology. So, yeah, so that's about what we do. And I kind of help coordinate that out here locally in the Atlanta area.

Rahat Chowdhury  1:54  
Nice. Awesome. So, you mentioned that you're in the leadership team for, I guess, the Atlanta Charter. So there's...how many different charters are there?

Cecilia Martinez  2:03  
Oh, wow. Yeah, there's quite a few. So Atlanta is one of the newest chapters. We just we had our launch event in November. We definitely, but we got started probably in about August. So Gary is our program is on the board. And he's a program director for out in tech. And he essentially they start with getting some information about who might be interested in the chapter locally. And then they also then he's kind of recruits and sources, a leadership team. So we do have I'm just taking a look at the the chapters here on our website. We have quite a few I mean, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Portland, Chicago, DC, Boston, Austin, more on the way I know that they are they one of Miami is kind of starting new ones every month, it seems like as well. So it's definitely a growing organization. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  2:50  
So how did you get recruited into, you know, joining leadership team? 

Cecilia Martinez  2:54  
Yeah, so it's actually it's kind of an interesting story. I actually just came out last year. So, I came out last year, a month or two after that I saw this like survey floating around about gathering interest for an out in check Atlanta chapter. And I was actually surprised that there wasn't already something for the LGBTQ plus tech community in Atlanta because both of those communities are very active and strong here. Like we have a great LGBT community and also a really active local tech community. So I saw the survey responded was like, Yeah, I'd definitely be interested in attending events and like, also check the box for volunteering. And I got an email, you know, asking to, like, do a call with with Gary and I just kind of talk to him a little bit about my experience and kind of like, why I would be interested. And then at the end of the call, he said, Great, like, I would love for you to join the leadership team and help us launch this chapter. And I was kind of like, Oh, no, I think you're mistaken. Like, I don't really have a lot of experience in this area. Like I've never, you know, and he was like, No, like, you know, you're passionate. I think that you have, you know, what it takes and kind of was Just like, got me to say yes, so to speak, and I'm so glad that I did. Because it's something that, you know, I don't necessarily have like a lot of local or like a lot of volunteer leadership experience. But the, the experience so far has just been really amazing. And seeing the response from the community, like, if there was somebody that just had to do it, so that I could get done. I'm, you know, I don't know if I was necessarily like, would have been like number one choice but I'm glad that I did do it because now we have seen the results from that and it's just been really amazing the response from the community so so yeah, so it was basically just like I kind of I checked the box and then got got recruited. So just kind of like being at the right place at the right time and a big part of it. So

Rahat Chowdhury  4:42  
you do I guess, a lot of like, coordinating with events speaking that kind of thing.

Cecilia Martinez  4:47  
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So basically, we had a launch event in November and we partnered with Flatiron School and we work so but are in school is a partner for out in tech, like on the global level. And so it was kind of like an actual partnership at the beginning to start out with just a lot of the Flatiron School right in Midtown. So Midtown Atlanta is kind of known for like, it's like for its LGBT, q like, it's kind of like the neighborhood, essentially, where like all the like, events are and it's just like a very queer friendly locations. So that was a good really, a natural fit was the flat iron location admin town for our launch party. And then we kind of just like started getting the word out as much as possible. And we really wanted it to be community driven in that we were going to start having these events in order to get the word out. But then from those events, get feedback about what kind of things people would like to see in the community, and what they would like to see from us as a chapter. And honestly, like, you know, it's been amazing. I've been to some other tech meetups and people in tech aren't always the most sociable people you know, it can be a little bit like pulling teeth to get some thing edge and come out to things and that has not been the case at Out in Tech meetups, it's actually been amazing. Like, it almost feels like people were just waiting for the space to be able to like, come and engage and talk and share because we never have to, like we had to speed networking event and we had to like force people to stop talking, like and move on to the next partner because it just like everybody is is so like, so hungry for the opportunity to have to, like socialize in this space, especially with other people in similar situations with them. So one of the things about out in tech is that quite a few I don't know the exact percentage. So I would hate to be wrong, but something about like about 40% of people are actually out at work because they don't have this psychological and social and financial safety to do so. And so, being kind of an area where people can maybe talk about that about what it's like in their workplace or maybe give resources to find a better job where they can be out at work or just kind of commiserate and navigating certain social aspects like do I mentioned my partner at work? Do I if it comes up like do I you know, How do I navigate that? When do I bring it up? How do I bring it up those kind of things. And so it's really been we've had a meetup every month so far, starting since November, and the attendance has just grown. We've had a lot of response from companies in the area that wants to host our events, we've had events at, we had the flatiron and we work. And then our December event was at Microsoft Store location. And then we had an event at VMware. And we specifically wanted to partner with VMware because they have really amazing programs and healthcare for specifically for trans employees. And  Dex our chapter head is trans and so that's something that we really want to like, focus on how communities support that part is like kind of like the rainbow, you know, that aspect of it with not only with health care, but also with, you know, like social support and, and different logistics regarding transparency, things like that. So, so VMware was a great partner for us in January and they spoke about how they had You know how their programs work and their ERG's internally. And then last month, we had our networking at a company called sansara, which is in Atlanta, and we partner with their ERG, which is employee resource group. So a lot of companies, when they get to a certain size will have these kind of internal groups, something you know, for LGBTQ, and they have ones for like, like Latinos or, you know, black employees in order to kind of organize events and provide support. And so we like to partner with companies that already have existing support systems in place for their employees, we definitely kind of want to make sure that their company is better walking the walk before we let them kind of CO sponsor that with us. That's something that we feel very importantly, that it's like, you know, that if you want act, there's a lot of times companies want to host because they're looking to recruit, and it's, you know, if you want access to our membership and to our resources and, you know, making sure that you are also a company that aligns with our values. So, yes, we even have, we have a great response. We have things planned out, you know, through May Right now, which is which feels great. And that might change a little bit given all the health concerns that are going on right now with Coronavirus or COVID-19. But, but honestly, I'd like that has given us just such a warm welcome.

Hasibul Chowdhury  9:13  
That's good. I actually am a flatiron grad. Flatiron actually does a pretty good job trying to get everyone to be open. And even if you're not part of that community, what they do is weekly feelings Friday. Flatiron just trys to make everyone feel inclusive and safe.

Cecilia Martinez  9:30  
That's really awesome, actually, because I know that like I know Rahat you've talked a lot about to about like mental health and tech and the LGBTQ community is like statistically, especially like for the trans community is like adversely affected when it comes to like suicide rates and things of that and things of that nature. So like providing like just like kind of like promoting the idea of like open communication and normalizing things like using pronouns and in like social settings and I think that really goes a long way in Not only supporting like from an LGBTQ perspective, but also from like a mental health and tech perspective as well. I know personally, like I'm queer, but I also, you know, you know, have different like, I have anxiety and stuff like that. So that's, that's really awesome to hear that. I feel like in general like boot camp grads tend to be more, you know, from underrepresented groups. And so it all ties in to kind of like how I feel about just supporting people coming into these different types of groups in tech and making sure that they like feel welcome and safe and, and included because they deserve to be

Rahat Chowdhury  10:36  
I think, yeah, we probably don't do enough in terms of mental health for like, different marginalized groups of people in tech. I guess what are your thoughts on like, how we can, I guess do better, especially for like the LGBTQ community?

Cecilia Martinez  10:55  
Yeah. So I think like kind of what I hear from companies a lot of times are like as VMware specifically, they have this kind of saying that they want you to be able to bring your whole self to work, you know, and I think being...so kind of just like a personal nature. So I mentioned that I came out last year, I'm, I'm bi or pan depending on however, you know, whatever terminology you prefer to use, which means that essentially just means that I, you know, will have relationships with people from any gender for all genders. And then so, I came out last year and in my previous life, I worked in finance, like finance, I worked in financial services, I worked at a couple different like brokerage firms. And it was definitely a situation where I didn't feel like I could bring my authentic self to work. Not only just like from a LGBTQ perspective, but I'm also I'm Latina, and that aspect of it as well, I you know, being like the only person of color at the office that I worked at, you know, felt pressure to like straighten my hair. I have like very curly, you know, like ethnic looking hair and Things like that and it's something that I didn't really necessarily realize until I moved to Atlanta which is like a much more diversity and and people are like a lot more authentic here. I didn't necessarily realize how I how difficult it is and how much mental weight it takes to have to put on like a persona when you go into work when like where you spend like eight hours of your day, every single day being somebody that's just not your authentic self. And how difficult that is. And that's something that I think fostering an environment where people feel comfortable talking about Yeah, like this is my family. It may not look like your family, but that's okay. And you know, this is what I do on the weekends and this is who I am and this is how I dress and this is what my hair looks like. Because honestly like the mental tax that comes from not being able to be yourself. Is is like is is prohibitive to be able to, to do good work and to be like your best self at work and be able to bring off fast Have you because that's really a benefit to the company is you've been able to be your best employee and best so and so i think i think it's not only necessarily though, like I said, like talking the talk, but also walking the walk as a company. So, there's also another quote that, you know, diversity is inviting some, you know, inviting people to the party, but inclusion is, you know, asking them to dance kind of a thing. So, like really making sure that not only are they are they allowed to be present, but they're also allowed to speak and have an opinion and form policy and, you know, and be able to, like, challenge things or ask the uncomfortable questions or challenge like, why do we do it this way? Has it always been done this way, you know, so really just like, enforcing that. Do you know that it's not always going to be a comfortable transition to having a more inclusive work environment, but that at the end of it, you're going to have so much benefit from it. They and also just like and also getting resources and reaching out to leaders in that in those communities. So not necessarily just saying like, well, I, you know, our leadership who is maybe consistently white and straight or You know, and male, feels that this is the best way to proceed, but actually reaching out to those people that are in the communities that you're trying to address, and getting their feedback and their resources. And that's something that we're really trying to do actually in Atlanta, specifically without in tech is gather and these types of resources from companies that are doing it right, and sharing it with the companies that want to do better, and kind of holding them accountable. And then, but then also providing resources and providing, like, writing points of contact for companies that do want to improve their diversity and inclusion. So yeah, so I think that it's, it kind of comes in a couple different levels, but ultimately, it has to be top down. So you need to have buy in from people like at the very Talk in order for that culture to take place, because ultimately, you know, you can have like great managers and you can have an energy or you can have like, you know,

feelings Friday, right kind of stuff. But if people don't actually feel comfortable engaging authentically in those environments, then it's all just like theater, it's not actually going to make a difference in your organization. So getting stakeholder buy in from the from the very top and having it and having your culture be intentional. That's another thing actually, it's a question that I asked in my interview at Cypress was like, do you feel that your culture here is intentional? Because I think culture is going to happen regardless of whether you plan it or not. And so I think if you just kind of hope for the best and say, well, we hire good people, and they get along well, and that's, that's our culture. If you don't have a plan for it, then it's going to it's going to develop it's on its own no matter what. And so I think having an intentional culture and from the outset, stating what your core values are as a company, and how you're going to achieve those values? And if diversity and inclusion, like is it aren't one of those values to why and challenge yourself on that. And then if they are one of those values, like Do they have the same kind of level of strategic planning that your other core values do? So, you know, are you take giving it the same severity and seriousness that you do as like growing your KPIs? Like, do you have KPIs around diversity inclusion? Like are you holding yourself accountable in those ways? I think that those are all things that companies can take a look at, and in making their culture more intentional, to be inclusive of, you know, not just for LGBTQ, but for all underrepresented groups.

Rahat Chowdhury  16:38  
Um, yeah, so you mentioned like you they kind of reached out to you to, you know, start this charter in Atlanta. What about like, I guess, if someone's from like a somewhere where it doesn't quite exist yet. They want to get involved or start a chapter, you know, at their location, what would be the best way to go about doing that?

Cecilia Martinez  17:00  
Absolutely, so we do have a out in tech slack that is like a global slack. And then we have channels for each of the local chapters. So, you know, there is, you know, you can go to outintech.com And you can contact them directly. But if you're kind of more just interested in finding out what it's like and seeing, you know, talking to other people in leadership team, you can definitely join the slack and then join like we have a general channel, we have kind of channels for each cities and getting involved with that. And otherwise, if you know for sure that you really want to start when your chapter these get the ball rolling, then you can definitely reach out to out in tech specifically. So Gary is the program director. He's the one that I've been working with specifically. I don't know if they have different ones for different regions, but and then essentially what it looks like what they kind of start out with is they start out with that kind of interest feeling. And one of the things that was kind of nice to was what I started is he said that you know by being part of the leadership team initially, it's our initial requirement is just like. See us through doing a launch event. And that's it. And after the launch event, if you decide, you know what, this is not for me, maybe it's not working for the city, then, you know, no hard feelings,  thank you very much for your help, you know, you can move on. But he did say that that's never happened before pretty much everybody who gets involved always wants to stay involved, and become part of the actual leadership team moving forward. And that was definitely like what happened in our case? So, so I think it's kind of like, once you actually like see it in action. It really is kind of infectious. You know, it's just seeing how much how much people like get involved and how passionate they are about it. If that really does kind of propel you forward and motivate you, but um, yeah, I mean, everyone has been always been super receptive. You actually also if you're on the leadership team, you get paired with a more senior leadership member from a different city. So I got paired with the leader, the leader of the Portland out in tech chapter, who they started about two or three years ago, so they're like, oh, Little bit ahead of us. But it was recent enough that they have kind of remember the challenges of initially starting up and getting things going. So that's been really helpful as well. So there's definitely a lot of support and mentorship that goes into it. It's not just a, you know, here's a style guide, have fun kind of a thing. Here's our logo. And it's very, very much involved, like involved at the with the global level of the chapter, or we started the organization.

Rahat Chowdhury  19:27  
Cool. Um, so are there. So you mentioned like, there might be some upcoming events? Maybe not. Because of the whole Corona thing. Are there anything? Is there anything that you're looking forward to? That's coming up?

Cecilia Martinez  19:38  
Yeah. So we actually were doing a panel this month about getting diversity and inclusion, right. in a in a startup. So Atlanta has a very strong startup scene, we have a lot of like our tech scene is growing exponentially. And so there's a lot of new startups. There's a lot of small companies and essentially Kind of what we were talking about earlier is even if you are a small company, how can you still get it right? How can you still make sure that you're including that as part of your hiring process and as part of your onboarding process. So we have a panel coming up this month on that topic I'm really excited about we also actually do have people from local government as well involve talking about how you can leverage community and local government resources. So Atlanta does have a lot of resources in that area. You know, even just like at the government institution level, so I was really excited to kind of get that support from the community as far as getting the panelists. We also are doing we do some fun stuff, too. So we did a speed networking and we're planning on having for April event, doing a trivia style event and having kind of like the pub style, you know, like pub quiz kind of style trivia. And that's, you know, the way to kind of get people mingling and get to know each other but then also having questions about tech about LGBTQ icons Atlanta history, kind of just general questions. So we like to kind of do a mix of things that are specific to tech. So in December, we had a, you know, somebody give a talk about getting started with UX research, and things that are specific to LGBTQ and diversity, such as or but at VMware and our panel, this one, and then also just like fun social things like speed, networking, and trivia. So we try to get a mix because different people want different types of content and different things, events will bring out different people. So we want to make sure that we're reaching like all different aspects and not always having things where it's just like a meet up at a bar, or just like only very specific technical content that might not appeal to everybody. Because, honestly, like our goal right now is just to get as many people aware of and involved as possible and like having like that wide swath, but we are getting to the point now where membership in our events are growing, that we can start looking at more specific types of content. So like whereas before, something like a really technical talk may not have gotten enough people Now we have the membership to support that. So we're looking at kind of branching out and maybe doing things like webinars or things that are more specific to certain subsets of our membership group. And then, but yeah, on the global level, we did have a New York event coming up in May for out in tech out in tech talks. But unfortunately, that was just cancelled due to coronavirus. And so because we were gonna have people we're going to be traveling for that. It was in New York City. So yeah, so we'll see maybe doing a lot more webinars coming up as opposed to or slack channels, as opposed to socializing in person. 

Rahat Chowdhury  22:40  
I think a lot of conferences and events are looking at doing webinars and remote stuff now.

Cecilia Martinez  22:45  
Yeah, as somebody who's like, so my job before this was 100% remote, so and I also like love online conferences and stuff like that. So but I also do really think that especially if you are underrepresented, having a place to physically look engage and interact and see other people like you is important. That was one of my experiences. I did a conference in Atlanta called refactor.tech. And this is their second year, but I volunteered at the conference last year. And it's specifically a diversity inclusion and tech conference that has multiple tracks. And that was my first tech conference, actually the night that I ever went to. And I think I got supremely spoiled, because the level of diversity and inclusion at that conference is probably very different than other tech conferences. And so like, you know, it was just great to see other people though, who were queer and brown and female, and we had all had pronoun pins and it was just a really fantastic experience and honestly made me feel a lot less nervous about going into tech because at the time I was still in my boot camp. And you know, you kind of like hear a lot of that it's just like the level stereotypes about the tech industry and how like, you know, it's not very inclusive and it's not very friendly. And so that I think Atlanta is definitely looking to change that or that Least is a very different type of experience because we're such a diversity. And I'm just really excited to be a part of that and to like, happy tell people like hey, like, you know, if you're different, like, come here, we're cool. Like, we're into it kind of a thing. So I'm trying to like kind of just like preach that gospel as much as possible for whoever will listen to

Rahat Chowdhury  24:22  
Awesome if anyone wants, like support in some way. You know, if we're not like part of the charters or doing anything like that, what's the best way to support?

Cecilia Martinez  24:32  
Yeah, that's a great question. So we do. There is a support section on outintech.com. One of the things that we do is every year we we do a build equality fundraiser. So that took place over in December and I was I was involved with that. It's essentially that supports our digital core that I was referring to earlier, where we help build websites to make the world safer for you know LGBTQ individuals across The world. And so that is a fundraiser that we do every year over the winter, I actually designed some custom, like holiday cards for anybody who donated to my campaign. They were out in tech kind of branded. But that's a great way to support. We'd like I said, we do have the digital core we have out in tech u right now we are actually looking for mentors for people who are interested in being mentors for queer and questioning youth looking to get into tech. So even if you're not able to, like, come to events, or if there's not a chapter in your area, that is something that's done like digitally and remotely, so you can get involved that way. And then of course, you know, we are a 501 c three, so donations are tax deductible. And we have a couple of different campaigns that we run throughout the year.

Rahat Chowdhury  25:46  
So given given that March is Women's History Month, what advice would you have for like women looking to get into tech or just like overall support inclusion in the field for women

Cecilia Martinez  26:00  
Absolutely, that's a awesome question. I'm super glad y'all are asking that. So I also volunteer with Women Who Code and I volunteer, I volunteer with the Atlanta chapter. But I'm also a track evangelist for Women Who Code front end. And I host our front end Fridays, slack discussions that we have each week. And it's something that's really near and dear to me, not only being a woman in tech, but also just in general, I mentioned that my bootcamp class was like, we tended to we were very diverse class and it was something where it really opened my eyes to how different it is for not only just like for people, for me, but also like people who are coming like, you know, different immigration statuses or like language difficulties. You know, people who just like have different family obligations and things like that. And so, I think, the intersectionality of being a woman but then also having other like things to consider So like my experience as somebody who is I'm Latina, but I'm like I'm white passing is a very different experience for like a woman of like a black woman, or I'm queer, but I'm also I, I'm in, like, you know, I am straight passing so to speak is kind of like a term that I've heard used before. And so I, you know, have different privileges and other people might not have them. So I think that being a woman in tech on its own is difficult. But also, I think acknowledging where you may have privilege as opposed to other women in tech, who have different inner inner intersections with other underrepresented groups is important and using your voice to help raise up other people who, like other women who may not have the same privileges that you do is something that is, I think, kind of the next step. So like once you feel like you have navigated that world and gotten to a place where you feel more safe and secure, like taking a look at those other intersections and how you can Pull others up with you and where you are. And I think a big part of that is kind of the idea of safety and numbers. So getting involved in your community and reaching out to other women, if there's not at your company, but maybe in your community, or if you don't have it in your community, then then leveraging resources like Women Who Code or like the global chapters, because I think the more that you talk to other women, and you have a sense of community, just kind of like the more confident that you feel, and getting resources and getting advice and how to navigate difficult situations where you may not feel empowered otherwise to do that. So, you know, I just I go back again to when I worked in finance, and there was it, you know, too many resources necessarily, and there weren't as many women and I never really thought to like, look to the community or to look to other resources. So a lot of it was just kind of was isolating and alienating and it's something where you never necessarily like, get past that point. But being in Atlanta and kind of having an forcing myself to reach out to others has not only made me stronger individually, but it's also allowed me to be in a position where I can support others. And that's a really great feeling to be able to help other people who are navigating it themselves and say, like, yep, I've been there. So have all these other great women have been there, too. This is what we did, this is what you can do. And then you know, down the line, they'll be able to pay it forward to somebody else. And so I would say yeah, like, definitely take advantage of those networks, those communities those resources and know that you're not alone and know that it's hard for everyone. And you know, and then also know like, once you get through it, you're gonna really feel it and you kind of never really get through all of it. To be honest, you know, you're there's always going to be challenges that come up. But I think it's for me, it was very motivating. Knowing that I would be able to help others once I became more confident and stronger in my abilities to navigate those situations.

Rahat Chowdhury  30:00  
Yeah, awesome. Um, one thing that you kind of said that I really liked was like the whole thing of like, letting people know that they're not alone. I think one of the things that one of the issues that are around this type of thing is that people kind of feel alone isolated, especially when you're like in a work environment where you don't feel safe. Something I've been kind of wanting to talk about in some of my talks, like on mental health in general. But I guess, like, what are, I guess some of the things that you all do in these events to kind of like, get that point across?

Cecilia Martinez  30:38  
Yeah, that's a really great question. So I think one of the things that we try to do, especially also when we promote the event, is to say even though we're called out in tech, you don't have to be out. You know, you don't have to, you know, you don't have to do that. If you come that you're going to get we are trying to try to be really accommodating as far as like if we post pictures of the event, and we know we don't, we don't Share our event bright, you know, guestlist with the companies that we have that host us, we don't share that information, we don't share any emails. Because we want people like, we definitely take the safety of our membership, very important. And so we communicate that, that, you know, you don't have to be out, we also have an extremely loose definition of tech. So even if you're just like remotely interested in tech, or you want to get into it, or if you work at a tech company, but you work in, like HR or something you're like, and then also that we we also, like, promote that we accept, or that we are very welcoming of allies, and anybody who supports our mission, essentially, because sometimes people will come and they'll feel comfortable or feel uncomfortable saying like, well, if I go then people like I'm not out. And I'm not sure how I feel about that or navigating that aspect of it. So we say, you know, allies are welcome. So if you come it doesn't necessarily mean anything. It just means that you're here because you support our mission. And so just trying to kind of make it feel as open and inclusive as possible because it's the first step and the hardest step is Like showing up. And then once you get there, you know, we really encourage discussion, we have a very, we also have, like, you know, strict code of conduct, you know, we don't allow you certain types of language and it's anything that's, you know, exclusive of any member of any type of person from any medical group. So it's like, you know, we try not to have, if anybody had like language around, like, Oh, I just in general, like, if you're there, because maybe you're like, you're gay, but you, but you don't like trans people. That's not cool. You know, he has to be inclusive of everybody in that in the LGBTQIA community. And, you know, we just encourage as much discretion as possible. And part of that, too, is being candid and being candid about the feedback that we're looking for. And so after, you know, basically making people feel comfortable, like, Hey, you can come to us if something happens if there's an incident and being responsive of that. Because if you see that in the leadership, then you feel more comfortable being able to express those things in there.

Awesome. So, um, we like to kind of wrap up our episodes with like, a little bit of a catch up, like what are you doing, you know, outside of, you know, out in tech or outside of work. So what's been going on?

Cecilia Martinez  33:14  
Yeah, so I did actually start a new job recently. And so I'm a success engineer at Cypress, which is very exciting for me personally, it is a great organization. It's a test runner is open source, which open source is something that I really am passionate about. So I've been doing a lot around there and getting up to date, it is no longer no longer remote, some adjusting to commuting and everything like that. So mostly just figuring out how to deal with the rain, I think has been what I primarily have been fighting against, but but yes, I've been where I do a lot of side projects. A couple of things that I'm working on right now. I'm actually working on some app development and working on like queer dating kind of social network apps. I've been working on getting better with testing in general and practicing that. I was doing live streaming for a while but have not been as up to date on that as unfortunately as I would like to be. But as some of the things like yeah, it's it's one of those things where it's like, it's fun and I like to do it but I think I've put in too much pressure on myself to like get it perfect each time and know what I'm going to be working on. So it's one of those like, death by procrastination or perfection things but in general, like I like hanging out my dog, I am really into music. I did some painting yesterday. I like to do creative things because I do things that are kind of more like less mentally taxing, and more just like creative expression type stuff. I do some video a little bit of video games, but it tends to be stuff like Pokemon or stardew valley.

Rahat Chowdhury  34:52  
You said like  two things I like to do and take up my time, Pokemon and Stardew Valley

Cecilia Martinez  34:58  
Yeah, ah, Yeah, I felt like stuff like that where it's like, you know, it's not like super mentally taxing but it's also like just enough engaging to like keep you going and stuff like that.
