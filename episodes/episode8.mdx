Rahat Chowdhury  0:15  
Hi, I'm Rahat.

Hasibul Chowdhury  0:17  
Hi, I am Hasibul and you're listening to tech4humans.

Rahat Chowdhury  0:22  
Welcome to a new episode of tech for humans. My name is Rahat. And today's guest is Andrew Hedges from the collab lab. Andrew, can you take a second to introduce yourself?

Andrew Hedges  0:31  
Yeah, sure. I'm Andrew hedges founded collab lab last summer. And I'm a I've been a web developer since 1998. So I've been doing this stuff for a long time. I'm currently an engineering manager at a company called Zapier but yeah, I'm excited to be here to talk to you.

Rahat Chowdhury  0:51  
Awesome. Can you give us sort of like an introduction to like, the collab lab is and maybe kind of like what your inspiration was for it? 

Andrew Hedges  0:58  
Yeah, for sure. I mean, the Kind of one sentence version of it is that collab lab is collaborative project practice for early career developers. So what happened is last summer, I was getting together with somebody who graduated from a coding boot camp here in Portland, Oregon, where I live. I taught at that boot camp, and I'm currently advisor there as well. But he and I got together and we were talking about how, after he graduated, he was having a lot of trouble. Just kind of staying motivated to keep coding, like he was, you know, like, you know, he wasn't really like making time for it and stuff. And I was asking him, sort of what would be helpful there. And he would, he said that, uh, you know, if he had other people that were relying on him kind of counting on him to, you know, be contributing to something that that would be helpful. And, you know, we were just as we were chatting, I just was thinking, like, there was a little app that I built for myself a couple of times. So, like, I knew, you know, I built it once, but then I rebuilt it in different tech stack, and kind of had a really good idea of like, what the requirements were and so I was like, You know, I could scope out this little project, probably, you know, maybe five hours a week for about eight weeks or something, get a little team together. And if I just kind of walked you to, like, help you through that, would that be helpful? And he was like, Yeah, that sounds great. So we were actually getting together right before a junior developer meetup here in Portland. And I talked to a couple people there and recruited another person who was like, Yeah, that sounds like an awesome idea. Found two other people and we had our first cohort. So that was back in July, and then we kicked off first cohort in August. You know, I was the the one mentor at the time. And these, you know, four people who sort of took a chance on the thing and we had a great experience and started, you know, started recruiting and it's kind of taken off from there.

Hasibul Chowdhury  2:45  
Rahat and I are actually both bootcamp grads. I'm not sure about Rahat when he graduated, since he did it last year, but my cohort when we graduated was February. I know quite a few. We're actually looking into joining the collab lab. I haven't followed up with a lot of them. I think, half of the cohort stopped communicating with us. I'm not sure what happened. But I know a few are actually still looking and trying to, like organize time to do the collab lab and it's great. Like you mentioned how it kind of helps people be held accountable since right now. There is no structure after you graduated boot camp is like, you know, the coaches aren't there. Your mentors aren't there telling you what to do next. So this is great that something like this exists.

Andrew Hedges  3:27  
Yeah. And it's, you know, we have a long backlog of people trying to get in and we're like a small program and stuff we're trying to scale it up. So you know, we still have people that were admitting into the program who gret who applied back in like, October so it's like there's like that's one thing that's kind of surprised me about the whole thing is just how how much demand there is for this, you know, everybody that I talked to, it's like, oh, my God, that sounds that sounds great. You know, I like there's it's the kind of fills a gap, I think, a lot of boot camps. It's tough for them. To make the time to really focus in on the collaboration skills, you know, you're there, you might have, you know, 12 to 16 weeks or something. And the curriculum is chock full of, you know, trying to get people up to speed on on different languages and frameworks and you know, building things and all kind of stuff. But it's, a lot of times the boot camps, they take a pretty traditional education approach where it's, you know, you are, you're working alone on something and you're kind of being graded on it. Maybe you do a group project here or there. There are a few, like, there's one here called Epicotus, where it's all pair programming, which is kind of innovative and stuff, but, you know, it's really hard for them to fit in the things that we do, which is, you know, a big emphasis on pair programming, a big emphasis on, you know, doing code reviews for for each other. So each each pair each week is responsible for completing one story, the other pair, then code reviews, their their work, the mentors, then code review, kind of get more of like a Some technical advice, but also the sort of the product owner perspective. So does it meet the requirements, that kind of thing. And then they have to, you know, merge, like they have to use like to kind of figure out merge conflicts and that kind of stuff. Then, each week, we get together and we do a synchronous call where, you know, we'll do demos of the week's work, we'll do every other week, we do a retro of how things are going, what we could improve. And then we do learning modules as we go. And it's a, you know, it's it's tough, like I'm saying for a boot camp to kind of fit those those types of things. I like to kind of add that structure to it. So yeah, everywhere I go and talk to people about it. They, they really kind of appreciate that. We're teaching these skills that, you know, it's really hard to get until you're on a software team, and it's I could go on I leave room for questions. But yeah, it's been really exciting to kind of the reception that we've, we've had to it.

Rahat Chowdhury  5:55  
Yeah, that's just like sort of thinking back to In my own boot camp, like we kind of had, like we went through the whole process of like being on teams and approving other people's requests, merging things like that, just like actually doing it. But like, I guess the philosophy the philosophies behind it were never actually practice. Like, we were just putting a rubber stamp of approval on everyone's met merge requests, we were actually thinking about, like, code reviews. I remember when I first started my own developer job, I was the first time I submitted a pull request, I was terrified. Like oh what's gonna happen it came back with like, a whole bunch of comments. I was like, No, this has never happened before. I've never gotten a comment on the pull requests I've made and like now I kind of realized that's not good. That's something really you know, should have been practice a little bit more so seeing something like this in a program was really awesome.

Andrew Hedges  6:53  
Yeah, when you when you do that, for the first time, it can feel like like a you know, the teachers taking a red pen to your work or something right. And what we really try to emphasize is that we are, this is not school, you know, you're no one's being graded. What it is, is a team trying to get something done, you know, and so we try to free people up from that mindset of like I have to perform at a certain level, or I'm going to be judged and stuff and really just make it I mean, make it a safe place. So what that means, like we've had, we've had a bunch of participants tell us that it feels safe to fail in collab lab, which is exactly what I want, you know, I want like, Oh, I did this thing. It didn't work. I didn't get the thing done in time, like, you know, at the merge conflict went terrible. That's fine. Like, it's all a learning experience. You know, like, the whole point is to learn and get better. And, you know, as a team, we have eight weeks to kind of work together and we'll get as far as we can. But we're gonna support each other along the way and we're gonna do our best to kind of teach each other as we go as well. So that's the approach we try to take.

Rahat Chowdhury  7:56  
So you mentioned earlier that there's like a long backlog. People who've applied trying to get into the collab lab. I guess for those folks who are kind of like, gotten through what's like the application process like for them?

Andrew Hedges  8:11  
Yeah, we have a, we have an application form on the website. You know, we've asked for things like your GitHub username. You know, if you're, if you're a little side note, but if you're an early career person, and you're not in GitHub, you should get on GitHub and be active on there. It's It really is. It's a it's like the place that hiring managers look to see, to get a sense of, you know, what, you know, and like, how, how actively you're coding things. There are lots of other options, get lab, Bitbucket and different places where you can put your code to do a lot of the same things. But the default really is GitHub. I mean, everybody looks there. So all of our projects are on GitHub, they're all you know, they're all kind of open to, for people to look at and, you know, you get that little contribution graph thing going in to kind of you know, just It looks good on your profile anyway. So we asked for a GitHub username, you know, we asked sort of what you've done so far to, you know, to kind of to learn, you know, development like web development. We asked sort of, you know, what, what do you like, why are you interested in the program, then things like timezone and stuff like that, too. So, you know, with all that information, we do our best to sort of take people in the order that they that they applied. So that's why we're still kind of processing people from a few months ago. Because there's so many people who wanted to get in. I mentioned time zones, and that's actually one of the things that, like, we've only been able to run cohorts sort of in North American ish time zones so far. And so there's a bunch of people around the world there's people in India and South Africa and Europe and different places that have who wanted to get in and do this, but we haven't. Like it's we haven't be able to ramp up quite that far yet. So If anybody out there is from one of those parts of the world kind of outside, you know, like North and South America, hang in there like we are. We're doing our best to kind of identify mentors in those regions, and to try to run cohorts in other parts of the world, too.

Hasibul Chowdhury  10:13  
Yeah, that's great that you're trying to accommodate everyone. And you know, you mentioned that there's a long list of people waiting, I think that's a good problem to have. You know, like, you know, that you're doing good for people iand that everyone's interested. You know, how often does a new cohort start? You mentioned? Like projects are eight weeks. Are you doing one every week? Eight weeks, or there's a break in between?

Andrew Hedges  10:36  
Yeah, we've been we've been slowly kind of ramping that up so that we're watching cohorts faster. So you know, the first one we did, we didn't know how it was going to go, whether it was even going to work and so that when we did the full eight weeks and then started recruiting for the next cohort, then for a while we were doing about launching a new one every every six weeks, and we've just recently moved to launching one every four weeks. So I went on a little recruiting spree for mentors And found a few people got them trained up. And then now we're, we're launching new cohorts with someone who has mentored before, and then two new mentors. So that we have, we can build up the pool of people who've been through a cohort and can start, hopefully start to run even more, you know, maybe we're, we get to launching every couple of weeks or something. So, yeah, we're, we're trying to ramp it up, because there is a lot of demand

Rahat Chowdhury  11:27  
When you have these mentors, kind of like, I guess, leading or teaching these cohorts, do you have any sort of curriculum or guidelines that they kind of follow?

Andrew Hedges  11:36  
Yeah, to some extent, I mean, it's, um, we have a, like, the main thing that people work from is we have a, you know, a project board and GitHub, with all the issues laid out in sort of order that they need to be completed in order to build the little app. And I could tell you more about the app if you want. But in addition to that, so they basically each pair like I said, the four people they pair up Each week, each player takes one story off the board puts it in in progress, they work on it, and it kind of goes through the whole full flow. In addition to that, every other week, we do a retro, but on the off the opposite weeks, we'll do what we call learning modules. So typically, those are things like how to do a good code code review, like what's what a code review is good for, like how to how to do a good one. How to pair program effectively. Accessibility is another topic that we've covered a couple of times. And we've had, we've had alumni from the program come in and talk about their transition into their first tech, their first development job as well. So we try to offer you know, every other week we're doing a learning module and then on those opposite weeks, we do a retro so there's a little bit of structure to I'm not the most structured person in the world. So like I've, I've tried to give enough structure that that we can have a good experience but then a lot of a lot of respects to the group sort of self organized, they kind of Figure out how they want to work together and some of those things up to a certain extent. And every group is different. It's been really interesting.

Rahat Chowdhury  13:07  
Yeah, I'm with you on the non structure thing, what's the typical day like, I guess for one of your cohorts, you mentioned kind of like those code reviews or do they could go like, do a stand up and then kind of do their work. How does that kind of work?

Andrew Hedges  13:24  
Yeah, so the time expectation for collab is only five hours a week. So you know that there is a sort of a flow to the weeks that tends to happen, but it's not really dictated. So you have to do this on this day except for that weekly call. So how it typically goes we have the weekly calls on usually on Sunday afternoon. You know, we do get to the demo, the retro whatever, and then we the pair's split off with a mentor and they talk about the work for the upcoming week. So they make a plan. They create their branch they create maybe a draft PR they make sure they understand the acceptance rate. metiria they kind of get, they get ready for the week. And then it's up to the pair at that point to schedule time to actually get together and, you know, on a synchronous call and do some pair programming, they can use the time in between those calls to, you know, maybe they need to, you know, study react hooks, or, or some, you know, like, get familiar with the Firebase documentation or something like that. So they might spend some of that time between calls doing that we try to encourage and sometimes happens is that they get their PR submitted around Wednesday or Thursday, so that the other pair has time to review it, then they can react to those changes, and then it's ready for to go to mentor review. They can have a day to react to those changes. And then the ideal is that it all gets merged into the production branch into master before the call on on Sunday, so that can be demoing off the production side.

Hasibul Chowdhury  14:52  
Yeah, I think that's great. You know, giving them time to learn between the pair programming and it's wonderful, you know, My boot camp, we would try to do two or three pair programming sessions a week, and it helps so much just to understand and look at how other people solve problems or break down problems. You know, what do you define like a good pair programmer? Like, like, what skills are you looking for for a driver and navigator?

Andrew Hedges  15:21  
That's a great question. Yeah. So yeah, pair programming, it really is kind of the lifeblood of what we do. Like we, you know, there's when you have pair programming in a company, like you might there's like a lot of different dynamics, you might have two senior people pairing, and they were they're having a certain type of conversation, you might have a senior and a junior person pairing, which cases might be more of a teaching relationship going on. And then you might have two, you know, sort of early career people pairing and then it's a little bit more like, do you know how to do this? I don't know how to do this, like, what do we do? Let's look let's look it up, you know, like all that stuff, right? So like in in our setting, it's those two early Correct people. And so really, it's like, just being there to kind of, you know, there's a little kind of a Venn diagram of like what people know. And so, by pairing, you expand that, that sort of universe of what you know, what information is available to solve the problem. So I guess even having somebody there to talk to, you know, talk it through with a lot of times, you know, you kind of just figure things out faster. So, you know, people who are just very open to the other person's ideas, like, uh, I like to say that, uh, you know, sometimes it's actually faster, you know, if you're having an argument about the approach to something, it's sometimes faster just to say, let's just do it your way. And then if it doesn't work, okay, now, let's do it my way, you know, instead of like, spending half an hour arguing about the approach, right, so people that are low ego and can kind of just get in there and just like, you know, and kind of a, you know, growth mindset kind of learning oriented, who can get in and just kind of teach each other and learn from each other in an open way. It's kind of the ideal I think

Hasibul Chowdhury  17:00  
Definitely agreed that that ego needs to be checked out before doing a pair programming session. Yeah, for sure.

Rahat Chowdhury  17:06  
I guess in terms of the cohort, how would you define like overall success for a cohort? 

Andrew Hedges  17:11  
Yeah. And I was asking some of the mentors about this over the last couple of days, and it really, it really just comes down to did the people learn and improve, you know, like, it's not whether or not they finished the project or the quality of the project necessarily. So we've had, you know, varying levels of completeness and varying levels of sort of polish on the project and stuff. But what's most important to me, is just to kind of watch the progression of the people in the in the program, you know, there. It's actually really interesting because it's the other aspect of this that we haven't talked about yet is that the whole program is fully remote. Like, we don't really get together and do this stuff in person, right? So there's a and you know, I work at a fully distributed company as well. So like we're very we're acutely aware of sort of, what the skills are that you need to support. We've sort of had success in that environment. And most people come in and they don't have a lot of that experience some people do, but, you know, you come in and now there's kind of this progression that we see where, you know, four to six weeks in, it sort of starts to click with people, with the participants that they need to be just, you know, sort of oversharing in the slack channels and, you know, just being really kind of noisy about, you know, and like documenting everything else kind of thing. So writing things down, you know, sharing status mate way earlier than it feels like you should. And those are hard things to kind of get your head around at first, especially when you're early career you're worried that people are gonna think you're not, you're not good enough for something right. So so it's really fun to watch the successful cohort is the people that like to get to the towards the end, you know, six to eight weeks in and you see them gelling as a team and you see them kind of understanding what what their their pair, the person in their parent needs, what the rest of the team needs in order for the whole team to be successful. Like that's, that's what I like to say. Towards the end of these projects,

Hasibul Chowdhury  19:03  
you know, it's great that you help people improve on the communication skills, you know, what are some ways the collab lab like you or other mentors, help? cohort mates, you know, deal with stress and just getting a project done?

Andrew Hedges  19:17  
Yeah, that's a good question. Especially in this time, as we're recording, it's pretty stressful time in the world. And, you know, we, we really try to approach it just as a team, like make it as similar to workplace as possible. So, you know, you know, if you're on a team at work, and somebody's sick, or like, something comes up, like they need to go, you know, like the, you know, or have vacation planned even or something like that, like, you figure out ways to work around it. And we've had those, those kinds of things come up in I think every single call, you know, where I think the very first cohort there were two weekends when I wasn't available. And so it was just like, there was one person who had a little bit more experience and put her in charge and she kind of like kept things moving while I was away, you know, so We just figure it out. But just making sure that people understand that, that that's okay. And that, you know that there is outside life happening. I mean, this is a two month commitment. So a lot can happen in that time. So we're we're very understanding, there's a weekend when somebody can't make the call or, or something. But just like on a team at work, what we need from that person is to be very clear about, Oh, you know what, I'm not I'm too busy this week to get my stuff done. You know, I'm sorry, but is there somebody who can kind of pick it up for me and maybe one of the mentors jumps in and helps kind of move the thing across the line or whatever. But, you know, that's, that's part of being a good teammate, right is like kind of surfacing those things early, like, not keeping everyone sort of appraised of the status and stuff so. So yes, we just try to be supportive and treat it like a, you know, a real team of people because that's what it is a real team of people.

Rahat Chowdhury  20:56  
Can you share with us like any success statistics based on the cohorts, like folks who have gone on to find jobs or went on to full time development afterwards, 

Andrew Hedges  21:08  
yeah, for sure. We've had, I think, at least three people who got their first their first developer job during their cohort. Which is, which is, I mean, it's an in each case, they cited their, their collab lab experience as making it way easier for them to be able to talk about this stuff in an interview setting. So you think about, you know, you go through a bootcamp or you're especially if you're like, just studying on your own, you know, if you're doing this kind of online courses and stuff, you may not have ever had to say some of these words out loud, you know, in some interview, and you're like, uh, I don't know, I've never pronounced that word before, you know, some of those kinds of things. But if you're pair programming, you're talking to someone, you know, you're kind of having your, you know, you're building up those pathways to be able to pull that stuff out in interview settings. So now all three of those people said that it was a huge help. So we've had we actually have had, I went back and looked through everybody's LinkedIn this morning. And actually to the point where I got kind of locked into LinkedIn for a little bit, I don't know they have some algorithm, or if you clicked too many links or anyway. And we actually have, we've had a surprising number of people who are already developers participate as well. So it's not just like Bootcamp, people will like probably an average of at least one person out of each four person cohort, already was working as a developer. So that's, to me pretty interesting. Like, like in the current cohort that's going on. There's somebody who, she's been a developer for a couple of years, but she is the only technical person at our company. And so for her, she wanted to like understand, I mean, everyone talks about GitHub and pull requests and stuff, but I don't you know, she's never done it because she hasn't had to, she's just like, committing code and pushing it to the server, you know. So understanding a little bit more about how teams work. You know, that kind of applies. To a surprising number of people, I guess, yeah, there is kind of a baseline of technical skills that we asked for. Because, you know, we're not really in the business of teaching coding itself, right? So, but it's, it's a pretty low bar, it's like, you know, if I go to your GitHub, and I see a couple of react, you know, React projects that are more than just a boilerplate. And that's probably that's probably good enough, like, it's, you know, you should be comfortable with the tools. So, you know, Git and NPM and those kinds of things. You know, if you are sort of familiar with react, or vue or Angular or some similar framework, you know, you could probably, and you're willing to, you know, especially if you haven't done react, and you're willing to kind of put in a little bit of extra time and keep it to keep up with you know, like do some self study outside of the five hours. But that's, that's probably enough. Like you need to be comfortable JavaScript. But, but yeah, it's actually it's been interesting that To see because people who are even working as professional developers, if they're, you know, they're a couple years in, they're still learning stuff all, you know, through the cohort on the technical side, as well as the collaboration side. Because you know, we have very experienced mentors, like people who've been doing this for a long time, and other engineering managers like myself and stuff. So, you know, this, it's a chance, as a developer to even like to get some really good feedback on just kind of how to collaborate better with people.

Rahat Chowdhury  24:26  
Nice. Yeah. I remember when I was first checking out the website for the collab lab. I saw there was like a project, like building a progressive web app. Is that kind of like the project that everyone does?

Andrew Hedges  24:40  
Yeah, everyone's doing that same project for now. Like, I have a goal. It's not my top goal for the year but one of my goals for the year is to maybe get a second and third project type that we could offer. But for now, everybody does the same thing. And that kind of keeps it keeps it simple. On the administrative side, you know, we can we have a thing that just generates a project board and all kind of stuff so But yeah, it's so it's basically it's create react app. Firebase, you know, firestore is the database. And Netlfy is the deploy. I mean, it's like, it's literally about that simple. There's not much else to it. But it's nice because the toolset, you know, it's all very well documented, well supported tools. That means that we can, we don't have to, you know, we're not fiddling with the technology itself, we're really focusing on these kind of catalytic skills that try to teach.

Hasibul Chowdhury  25:31  
I forgot what I read this as someone who mentioned that, every time they try to pick up a new language, they just build the same project over and over in the new tech stack. And I know before we even started this podcast, you were mentioning how you do that too, like, you had a project in mind. And that's what led you to passing this project on to the cohorts at collab lab. You know, what are some things you've learned from watching other people like do your projects over and over?

Andrew Hedges  25:58  
That's a great question. It's actually been really funny because I, I created all the all the stories, you know, it's for, based on, I just like took like how I built the project and like, basically wrote stories out, sort of in a rough order what I thought and it's been, it's been very fascinating and kind of humbling experience to watch each cohort struggle with these stories like, this is not clear at all, they'll do something that's like, Oh, I didn't even think of that. But yeah, I can see how you'd get that from the way I wrote the story and stuff. So it's, we've had some, some little detours along the way because of that. So each time we try to, you know, we notice something where people got confused or something, we try to go back to the stories and just make them a little more clear and stuff. But that's been the biggest thing, I guess. It's, it's just really interesting just to watch. Like, there's actually one one very specific thing. So the app itself is this kind of smart shopping list app. And the idea is that as you as you make purchases, like as you make repeat purchases, especially, it starts to learn sort of the interval at which you buy different things. So, let's say you buy eggs every two weeks, right? So, you know, one week, it's 12 days, but another week, 16 days, whatever, like, it figures out that 14 days approximately is when you're going to buy eggs. And so what it does is, as you get closer to that, that next purchase date, it moves that item to the top of the list. So that's the basic theory of the, the app. Well, there was a, you know, wait when I built it myself. I, you know, I counted when you added the item as the first purchase, like I was thinking like you'd be in the store. Yeah, you'd say like, Oh, I'm going to get ramen or something like that ramen. And the thing that's your first purchase? Every cohort has wanted wanted to not work like that. Like, Oh, yeah. So you want to make a list ahead of time. And then as you actually make the purchases, just mark like, you know, hit a button that says it's purchased. Okay, that that makes a lot more sense.

Hasibul Chowdhury  27:51  
I can see how both ways work.

Andrew Hedges  27:53  
So this is fascinating, you know.And there Yeah, it's it's been fun to kind of watch this. People take the you know, the the project itself and the requirements and stuff and interpret them come up with things that are mostly the same, but like have some some real variation to it.

Rahat Chowdhury  28:10  
one of the things that really drew us to the collab  lab to bring you here onto the show. When I was reading through the website, again, I saw that you mentioned the club is aiming to kind of bridge the gap for women and underrepresented minorities in tech. And we wanted to guess, what are some steps you've taken in pursuing that goal? 

Andrew Hedges  28:31  
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, cuz I'm a white guy. So you know, I've been doing this tech stuff for a long time. And I've been paying attention to diversity issues for a while. And I just realized, you know, a lot of times like if something gets started, and the first few people are, you know, they're too similar. Then he kind of gets us momentum, right? Like you. It's really hard to break out of that after the fact. So, you see a lot of startups where it's, you know, four friends may do a startup, but they're all maybe they're all white guy is in San Francisco or something, right. And so like, pretty soon it's 16 white guys. And then it's like 32, mostly white guys, and it's like hard to then steer the ship over to, to being a truly diverse and inclusive kind of place. So now right off the bat, I mean, the very first cohort has been true for every cohort, we, they're structured. So it's one man and three women, or three non male presenting, like wherever you fall on the, on the gender spectrum. So, and that's been, that's been kind of a core thing we've continued throughout. So it's probably a little frustrating for the men who've applied because it's taking them longer to get in the program. But it also like one of the, you know, tech can be not always but it can be kind of a hostile place for women and it's like this, they're the attrition rate for women is true, are much higher target for them to get jobs or to kind of get, you know, to be seen as being as technical as Those kinds of things, right? So one of the reasons that, you know, if you think about a cohort of four people, and you're doing pair programming, if it's, if it's 50-50 two men and two women, then women are having to pair with men, two thirds of the time. If it's three women and one man, you're pairing with women, the majority of the time, like, the man is always pairing with a woman, which is fine. It's, you know, for some people, that might be a good learning experience for them. But the women are, you know, most of the time also getting to pair with other women and it's like having a just, you know, again, it's all around trying to make this like a safe place to experiment and just try try and not not be judged for, you know, identity stuff, but just be there to do the work, you know, so. So, that's been one thing. We've, you know, wherever we can, I mean, you know, we don't always know the race of people when they're coming into the program, but, you know, we've been pretty good about getting people all kinds of races. You know, In cohorts, we had a cohort that was three black women in it. And that was great because I felt like for them, they could just relax and just like be themselves, not be the one person who kind of stands out and that kind of thing like it was. It was actually a really fun cohort as well. So we have a code of conduct that we take seriously. We've had we have three, a responder team of three people who have all been through training. Like really good training on we did a GoFundMe to kind of pay for some, some training for them. And, yeah, I mean, it's, it's something we were intentional about take very seriously. So,

Hasibul Chowdhury  31:39  
yeah, that's great. You know, he just mentioned GoFundMe right now and collab lab is it for those who don't know, is free, and it's run by volunteers. So you know, what are some ways people can help? collab lab and help? You know, the cohorts as well?

Andrew Hedges  31:54  
Yeah. I mean, right now we have we're not quite yet an official 501 c three. So we have applied for that status. And we're kind of waiting for that to come through, it's going to be a little user to help us once that happens. So hopefully that comes through the next couple of months. takes a while and it probably with current situation, it might take a little longer than normal. But for now, what we have is I have my I personally have a GitHub sponsors page up so people can, you know, they can sign up to donate, you know, four, eight, sixteen dollars a month, whatever it is. And that helps offset all kinds of costs. So like we pay for a pro zoom account so we can have good high quality calls that we can record longer than 40 minutes. We were we on this on the free slack plan for the moment, but like once we get nonprofit status, we'll we'll be able to open that up with more features. We don't have a lot of costs, to be honest, like the training was probably our biggest single expense, the pro zoom account and then we have a G Suite account that So yeah, that's a few dollars a month for each of the people that are in there, but beyond just financially, you know, just kind of, you know, amplifying our message to the like, so we're on twitter at underscore collab underscore lab, just because those are common words, and they were all the better usernames are taken. But anyway, we maybe we can throw a link up on the site after this, but um, yeah, just kind of, uh, you know, retweeting us or just kind of helping us find both mentors and participants. I mean, we have a long list of people, but like I said, we're, you know, trying to scale up and try to expand in other regions and stuff, too. So. Yeah, and just like is actually the biggest single thing would be also to hire the people who the alumni, the people who go through the program, you know, a lot of them either have jobs or find jobs, but a lot of them are still looking for their first kind of tech job. So I write a recap. I've started writing a recap of each cohort as it ends, and kind of talking a little bit about what made that one unique. just you know, it's more kind of portfo lio material for people to be able to point to for hiring managers and stuff. But now the whole point is to get people bootstrapped into that first job, they get that first job. And you get that second job. By the time you have had that second job in tech, you kind of set like, you don't have to worry too much about it at that point recruiters are coming to you. But until you have that, you know, it's um, it's a tough thing to break into,

Rahat Chowdhury  34:02  
for anyone listening, we'll definitely be sharing those things out in the show notes. But yeah, you mentioned is folks kind of like after you're still looking for, you know, some jobs. And you write up that, I guess, reflection on the cohort. I guess what's the level of involvement with mentees sort of like after the cohorts?

Andrew Hedges  34:54  
Yeah, that's a great question too. And we we really do want collab lab to become a community right? We will have all these people to sort of stick together and support each other through their careers. And we've seen a bit of that we actually, probably maybe because I'm in Portland, Oregon, so that's where my network is only so probably about half the people who've gone through it are here in Portland. So one of our board members, Stacy, she was up, she came up from Sacramento. And so we got everybody together. And we all went out for dinner and stuff and kind of had a great time, just kind of, for the most cases meeting each other in person for the first time. But a lot of people, they'll stay active in slack and kind of, we have a channel learning together where people will post, you know, articles that they found, or they'll ask questions about things are trying to get done. And then we have a, we started to kind of put together committees to where people can stay involved. So we have a website committee. So, you know, people who've kind of been through the program can help us sort of with the next iteration of the website stuff. So we're trying to find different creative ways to get people to stick around and keep on you know, stay engaged and Mostly to support each other as they, as they're trying to kind of get their foothold in tech.

Hasibul Chowdhury  36:05  
what are some advice that you have for people looking to break into tech? You know, be it just bootcamp grads or career switchers, or even college students?

Andrew Hedges  36:19  
Yeah, super good question. Yeah, it's, uh, it is tough. I mean, the thing that, you know, I think it was Steve Martin, who said that be so good that they can't ignore you. Like, that was his advice when he was like for somebody to try and like break into comedy or something. And I think there's something to that, like the the thing is, like, the main thing is to just get really good at your craft, you know, so it's a lot like learning any other language or learning an instrument or something. If you're doing it every day. You know, you're it's really a process of rewiring your brain to do this thing, that there's no reason why your brain should be able to do this thing. But like As humans, we can kind of like teach it to, right. So, so daily practice like this getting in and doing some code, or at least like reading some code every single day. And then, you know, if you're trying to break in, like, you've kind of got a base of skills, like you, you need to show hiring managers, what you can do, and it's not only sort of what your what you can accomplish, it's because a lot of times, you know, when you're early in your career, you have big gaps in your knowledge, right, like, you know, you maybe have done a couple of things and you've gotten kind of good at them. But tech is such a big a big thing, like, you know, you never know like to the company you go into there may be they may need to do something totally different. And in that case, what's more important is how fast you're learning. So, you know, if you can, and what your processes and those kinds of things like if you're, you know, if you can show that you have some structure around how you how you ramp up on our new framework, for example. So one of the things that we also encourages for people just to be to be writing about, you know about tech. And it's it's pretty intimidating to get started with that, you know, if you're early career you think like, oh, nobody, nobody cares what I think about this thing. But it's not really the point like the point is, it's kind of twofold. One by writing it out you're forced to explore some of the nooks and crannies that you might have glossed over when you were sort of studying, right. So you actually end up learning and better if you're trying to explain it to somebody else. And the the other kind of side effect of that is that you build up this sort of this corpus or something that you can show to employers. You know, here's when I was learning react, like, here's how I went about it. And, you know, here are the things that I learned and here's where I made mistakes and how to recover from mistakes, like all that stuff. Well, you kind of build up this thing that people can look at. So, you know, kind of doing that stuff in public. I would encourage people honestly to get on Twitter and connect with other early career, people. No, we've, we have we've had some people through the through collab lab who, they're super active in Twitter and they get so much support from each other. And they, they can ask a question and you know, get a bunch of, you know, kind of pointers of like, Oh, this is a good website, or good good blog article or something to read on that topic or whatever. But you kind of get involved in a community and you kind of the system is good for motivation. If not, if nothing else, right, like you have a group of people that are also going through this thing with you and kind of help each other. Stay motivated and lift each other up. So it's a, the numbers are hard. Like I know, like in Portland. There's a junior developer meetup here that has about 2000 people in it or something. Not all, they don't all show up for every meetup, but there's a it has a big list of attendees or a big list of kind of list. And it's not that big of a market for jobs. You know, like at any one time, you might find five or six jobs that are explicitly labeled, you know, for junior developers in the whole city. So It's tough, right? But you know, I would encourage people to stick with it, I would encourage people to be creative about what kind of role they're willing to take. So, you know, there's a, sometimes technical support roles can be pretty technical. And they can also be a foot in the door to, you know, kind of take on, like to continue learning at least, like, I know, New Relic here in Portland has a program called ignite, where they take, you know, cohorts of four coincidentally, but, you know, kind of early career people and they have them do rotations through product teams. And, you know, if you were, if you get into New Relic as a, like a tech support person, like you're supporting a very technical product, you're around a bunch of engineers, so the people you can learn from, so, you know, or if you're like doing a QA engineering or you know, there's different roles that you can do that aren't necessarily, you know, software engineer, that will help you just be around it, you know, be in the industry. And then, you know, you keep ramping up and then eventually, you know, hopefully you find that first sort of pure programming role.

Rahat Chowdhury  41:00  
That advice is really awesome. One thing that I think that really resonated with me was the whole kind of learning in public and just kind of like writing about things and whatever you're learning, just like putting it out there. When I was the first looking for my first developer job, I decided to just submit to like, local meetups and conferences and just see what happens. And a couple of people actually wanted me to come in and talk and I did some like live coding. I don't know what possessed me to do that but I did some live coding talks for like one of my was like my second talk ever, completely screwed it up. It didn't work out the way I wanted it to. But even like afterwards, at the end, people still came up. And were just like, still asking me questions about technology. I was, you know, demonstrating And you're trying to learn, and it just kind of like goes to show you like even when you're like messing up, or you feel like you're messing up. Other people might not see it that way. And they, they might still, you know, get something from that. And it also helps you, then you know, what you did wrong this time and. You're better next time. I think that's definitely, really good advice. You also get like a whole bunch of feedback from people. When you're doing this stuff in public, and just pick up on things that you might not have thought about before.

Andrew Hedges  42:35  
Yeah, for sure. And I love that you were brave enough to kind of get up there and just do live code like that. I mean, I don't know. I don't know that I've ever done that. I mean, it's, um, it's pretty brave of you. But yeah, you're right. Like, the thing that like, especially as an early career person like blogging about it, presenting about it, those kind of things. Like if you're, if you're Another early career person, and you're there watching it, like you're gonna have a connection with them, they're going through the sort of the same thing. Like they're you're having these realizations as you go, just sharing those things are super valuable. Like for me, I've been doing this stuff for 20 years. And so it's hard a little hard for me to relate to someone who's just learning some things for the first time, you know, like, like, Oh, yeah, not everybody knows that. I forgot. Right. But, you know, if you're in that same space, like, of course, nobody knows. You know what this thing is? I don't know, I can't think of a good example. But you know what I mean? Like, it's, um, so I think it's, there's a ton of value in that both for I mean, mostly for your own learning, but you know, it also just for making connections to people. It's kind of getting seen as a, as an expert on things it's, or if nothing else, just show that you're brave enough to get up and talking to people.

Rahat Chowdhury  43:49  
We usually like to wrap up our episodes with like a small catch up session. So what are you up to outside of work outside of the collab lab?

Andrew Hedges  43:59  
Yeah, so its a weird time You can't really go outside at the moment. We're all kind of locked down here in Portland. But um, there are a couple of the things that I am involved in. I helped coordinate a tech leadership meetup here in Portland. Just I mean, it's that's not a big commitment, but it's a lot of fun. That's good way to stay connected with other software people here. And then I also volunteer for an organization here called Pueblo Unido. And Pueblo Unido is an organization that helps people get out of detention from ICE. So there's, you know, it's it actually isn't illegal to be here in an undocumented status. I don't know if people know that. But people get still get thrown in detention. It's not called jail was called detention. Usually, if they have, you know, say like, you know, you're here undocumented, and you happen to do a DUI or something like they'll throw you in this detention where it's kind of like you may stay there for years. So but we need to actually help raise money to give those people legal representation, and to kind of actually be able to exercise their rights. Because you can imagine, if you're here, you know, have great language skills and that kind of thing. You know, it can be a pretty scary experience, and you're not sure how to navigate all that. So Pueblo Unido actually have sort of a state of Oregon contract for called, like navigation services for people in this category. So I'm on the tech, the tech committee for that group. Besides that, you know, just having a lot more time at the moment to like play guitar and stuff like that, because you can't do the normal like, go out to bars and restaurants in the evenings kind of thing. So hopefully, this all blows over soon.
