Rahat Chowdhury  0:15  
Hi, I'm Rahat. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  0:16  
Hi I'm Hasibul. 

Rahat Chowdhury  0:18  
And you're listening to tech4humans.

Welcome to a new episode of tech4humans. My name is Rahat. And on today's episode, we have Lee Warrick with us. Lee, can you take a second to introduce yourself to everyone? 

Lee Warrick  0:32  
Sure. I'm a full stack JavaScript developer.primarily working with front end technology. I've got experience in react node, vue, all that good stuff. Before I was a developer, I worked in the healthcare field. I was a firefighter and a paramedic. And after that, a registered nurse working in ICU ER, recovery, surgical a whole bunch of different areas. So yeah, that's that's the short version.

Rahat Chowdhury  1:00  
How'd you go from like, firefighter to nurse to dev? Like what was that kind of progression like? 

Lee Warrick  1:07  
So, um, long story short, I went to college originally to pursue a career in computer science like I wanted to make, you know, video games as a as a kid, and always love computers. So that's what I started out trying to do. And getting into college, you quickly find out that the reality of that is a little bit different than maybe what you think, in your mind. So they started me out with like binary and hexadecimal and all that stuff. I hated it. I was learning Java. My teacher wasn't really engaged. I wasn't really into it. So I quit that got in the Japanese language, got my degree in that. It's actually up there on the wall, but went to Japan for a year and went down that path and then realized I didn't want to live abroad. So I wanted to come back home to America. Being in Florida, there's not a whole lot of Japanese speakers. So getting into firefighting was kind of the fallback plan. So that's what I did sign up for fire school went through that to the EMT school paramedic school, got hired, and that kind of started down that path of healthcare. But those professions, I guess we'll get into in a little bit, are dangerous, low, paid long hours.very stressful. They, they take a very heavy toll on the people in those industries. And so I eventually got out of that, because boot camps had become a thing by that point. And so I signed up for coding boot camp, kind of always look back at my previous, you know, hopes and dreams of of working in software. And, you know, worked really hard in that. I went through the boot camp did well, and then got a job and been kind of living that life ever since.

Hasibul Chowdhury  2:56  
That's wonderful. Yeah, you mentioned that your fallback plan was to become a firefighter? Like, what made that your fallback plan?

Lee Warrick  3:04  
Yeah. Should I mention that My dad was a firefighter for 30 years. So he worked for Miami Dade County, here in Florida. And my sister's husband, so my brother in law, he is also a firefighter. And then my best friend's dad was a firefighter. So there was this big family of people that were in that field already. And so I had always looked at it like, well, that's a stable job, you know, great pension. You don't really need an advanced degree or anything. You just got to go through the training to do it. So when I had kind of run out of ideas, I guess at some point, I kind of got it in my head that I would like to do some of the medical aspects of it, not necessarily the the firefighting bit. And so I just kind of moved in that direction and went through with it.

Rahat Chowdhury  3:54  
So you've got this experience with being an ICU nurse being a firefighter. Now, you're dev. Do you have any suggestions on what people can do to like, or like things people can do like right now in our current state of affairs with the whole Coronavirus COVID thing going on?

Lee Warrick  4:12  
Yeah, so the whole Coronavirus thing is a pretty interesting development. Um, I can tell you that as like an ICU nurse we would have in the hospital flu season so that would be a busy season similar to how you might if you worked in a restaurant or something you you would know just the industry experiences season right? So like all these people come into the restaurant, all of a sudden you've got like a booming business for however many months and then out of season, things slow down to a point where you're kind of like rolling back your staffing and you're not working overtime, stuff like that. The same thing happens in the hospital. So during flu season, the hospital is like slammed full of people.Especially It's really widespread throughout the country. But particularly here in Florida, we've got like a large retirement population. And when those people get sick, your elderly don't have the same immune system or capability to fight off illness. It really could be anything, flu, cold, whatever. Whenever you experience an illness like that, it just takes a lot more out of you. So you may end up with, you know, acute respiratory distress, you may end up in the hospital, you can't breathe. Maybe your congestion is, you know, to a point where you can't handle it, because you're already kind of compromised, maybe you smoked, or maybe you have a bad heart or bad lungs already. And so you end up in the hospital on a ventilator or something, and then I would be taking care of you in the ICU.And so the same thing in that unit, we would have lots of people on ventilators during season. And then out of season it would be like, you know, we've only got a couple patients we're floating now there is, you know, pick up more or less acute patients, people that aren't as sickSo, with Coronavirus. The thing is that there's kind of this controversy out there of like, well, is it deadly? Or is it not deadly? And it is deadly. But if you look at the numbers, it's like, oh, well, if you're between the ages of 18 and 44, and I'm kind of pulling this out of my butt, but there's like a 1% chance or something that you'll die from infection. But as you get older, those numbers go up and up and up. So if you're over 85, you know, you have like a 27% mortality rate or something. And even to some people are like, well, 27%, that's pretty low. But the thing is, is whenever you get sick and you're older, you're going to probably end up in the hospital and you're going to be taking up those resources and it's a huge strain on our system. So it's an interesting problem. People kind of look at it as well. It's not that big a deal, I'll probably be fine. It's just like the flu or whatever. But on the other hand,  It's incredibly taxing for our healthcare system. And it is many magnitudes more deadly for people that are elderly, immunocompromised, or have other comorbidities where getting sick will impact them much more greatly than the normal average person. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  7:19  
You know, it kind of lines up with something like earlier today, New York state governor, had a press conference and we're just talking about how fast the cases are coming up. And to the point where I think the case will be like three times the amount of ventilators we have for New York State. And they're running out of resources. And then I saw a post on Reddit, about how in Italy there is a company that 3d printed ventilators and each ventilator was like $1 in material. And this other company that actually makes the ventilators was planning on suing them because their ventilators cost $11,000 for one and it's just crazy how all of this shady like...medical companies and their practice are coming out because of COVID-19. And it's kind of sad that we had to get a global pandemic for this to come out. But I'm glad that it's actually coming ou t like you don't need $11,000 for a ventilator.

Lee Warrick  8:19  
So yeah, I read that article and a couple of couple of points on that. Being somebody that worked in healthcare for a long time, I've kind of known how not scummy but scummy our healthcare system can be there's a lot of profit that drives those gears and makes everything function. So, you know, hospitals are set up to turn a profit because they, they have to make money in order to exist.Whereas other countries, you know, they have socialized medicine. So they've, you know, the government has stepped in and said doctors will get paid this much healthcare will cost this much so, so forth. Whereas here in America, that's  not really the case. So that was a big source of my strife and kind of burnout whenever I worked as a healthcare provider, like having to, for instance, type a lot of things in the computer, not so that we can record information about the patient, but so that we can more effectively bill a patient or bill their insurance. So things like that really grind against, you know, a lot of the motives that somebody would have for becoming a healthcare provider. But in the case of what you're talking about the ventilators, so a ventilator itself is like a giant machine that breathes for a person. So it's like, it's got pneumatics and machinery and electronics inside of it to automate breathing. So you give it settings and say, like, we're going to ventilate this person with so many cc's of air, it's so much pressure at such a rate. And you can't really 3d print one of those. It's like a huge machine. The piece that you're talking about is like maybe this big maybe three or four inches. And it's an attachment for one of the hoses, like goes in line with the ventilator, at least I'm guessing from the article that I was looking at. And that was being used to deliver some kind of supportive treatment. So it was like a throwaway piece that you probably had to use like one per patient or one per treatment or something for the ventilator. So for the company to charge $11,000 for a piece of plastic is kind of what I'm getting at, like, there's no real reason for that. Certainly, there's some standards and regulations that will drive up the cost of components kind of like if you own a boat, like, I know, we probably don't, because we're all developers, but as soon as you say something's theoretical, like it's gonna cost three or four times more just because it has to be certified and it's got to be waterproof and all this other junk, or food grade or something like that. I want to say something is a medical device and it can be used to treat somebody. It's the same kind of thing. It has to pass it on regulations and has to be looked at and double checked and triple checked and stuff. And that drives up the price. But does it drive it up? $11,000? I don't really think so. So it's kind of the same thing with the epi pen controversy from last year or the year before, where, you know this life saving, medicine and device. So anaphylaxis, and anaphylactic shock. You ever see somebody get stung by a bee in the movies or something and they're dead in a couple minutes, they swell all up in their air pipe closes. That's a real thing. And the treatment for that is epinephrine. So basically adrenaline to open up their air passages. And that device historically has been pretty dang cheap because epinephrine has been around for many years. And it's a generic medication. It's very, very cost effective to produce that there's no like patents on it anymore. But the device itself to deliver that is like a self contained syringe with a needle on the end that you can just kind of press against your leg and it will auto inject. And so this company that produced them, decided to charge $400 or something for an epi pen. Because they could because nobody else was producing them. And so that came out in the news like, Hey, what's this guy doing? I think his name was Martin Shkreli or Shkreli or something like that. Yeah. If you guys remember that. There's this huge controversy, like, why are you doing that? Well, the thing is, there's tons of companies doing that. So like, diabetic people, insulin, for instance, insulin can be produced incredibly cheap, because it's been around forever. It's a generic drug. However, you'll see drug companies and hospitals are prescribing like, brand name insulin that costs hundreds of dollars a vial and they're only charging that because they can and because you know that they can make a ton of money off of that. So this isn't really news to me seeing this kind of stuff. But I am glad that you know if there's any silver lining to this pandemic nonsense. It's that we're exposing some of these like, shady crappy things that are happening out there in the healthcare field. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  13:11  
You mentioned the insulin pumps and Rahat brought this up. I think you talked to him before about people like hacking the insulin pumps, to just like reduce cost. I did some research and I was seeing like one of the people that started this they saved like $800 just by not needing to upgrade their pump because they're able to hack their pump and discover new features. Do you have any more insight on that?

Lee Warrick  13:35  
so I can can't really speak specifically to that because I haven't dug too deep into that device. I can tell you that. an insulin pump is like a beeper if you're old enough to remember a beeper, like a beeper sized device that you guys are laughing so I take it you're that old? Yeah.Yeah, exactly. It's actually attached to some intravenous lines. That plug into you and pump the drug insulin into you at a controlled rate. So, as like a ICU nurse, maybe we would hang a bag of insulin and have it on an IV pump. This is like a tiny system that does that for a person. So these devices are pretty cool. They were removed the need for you to like, constantly stab your finger and inject insulin manually. If you're a diabetic, which is something that your pancreas does automatically, but as diabetic you lose that ability. So you got to do that yourself with medicine. And if your diabetes progresses to a point where you need that an insulin pump can be pretty dang helpful because it's automated. It does it for you checks your blood sugar, it gives you insulin kind of regulates things automatically. So I think Medline and probably some other companies develop, you know, these pumps. But there was a developer, Sarah Withhe, I believe she ended up writing some software to Modify hers and I didn't really dig into that you guys should actually interview her because I think that'd be a pretty cool episode. But another topic around that that I heard was DEF CON if you guys are familiar is a big cybersecurity conference. Somebody at DEF CON one time presented how you could access those insulin pumps over like an open network connection. So they were on some kind of frequency that he was able to access and he could control remotely insulin pumps within a certain radius around his computer and set different levels for you know, medication, and there's really no excuse for that. The company should have you know, measures in place to lock that down to have some kind of security. I'm sure that they have that port open for like if you go to your doctor's office and you need them to set your your pump or something or or get ready things off of it or whatever. But, you know, it's an unsecured connection. And so anybody can access it, which is crap. So there's just a lot of like the opposite of innovation in the medical field, that's just they, they do stuff and it's kind of whatever. As far as like the technical aspect of it, I can tell you that as a nurse, like I used to chart on a computer that was running a DOS program for the patient vitals and when we gave them medicine and stuff like that. And that's in the year, you know, 2015 2016. So, like, what and I worked for the one of if not the biggest Hospital Corporation in the world, and I'm at this hospital using this program that's written in MS DOS. So I'm like having to like use F keys and stuff to chart. That's BS. I don't know if we can cuss on here. I'd be cussing about this, but I don't agree with that. Like, you've got the resources you make millions upon millions upon millions of dollars. I've seen them remodel that hospital like eight times since I've worked there. And that's only been a couple of years ago. And you're telling me that you can't develop a software program that's basically a crud app to, you know, record information about patients. That doesn't really track with me, you know, you can hire a couple developers to do a better system than that. But they just haven't. They don't care. So there's no drive for them to do that. And it just, it's another thing kind of like this layer cake of disappointment I have with the healthcare industry. There's just a lot of room for innovation and improvement and some of those systems. I can tell you. in Orlando, for instance, we've got a company called party MS and their whole startup idea is around, like documentation and document management for first responders. So like as a firefighter We would have to do pre planning, where we would go into the building, and kind of map out the layout of the building and like where the exits are, where the fire extinguishers are, where people usually work at stuff like that, so that when we go on a fire, and it's filled with smoke, we kind of know where everything is. And, you know, in this modern era, you know, we had a computer, which was great, but we were doing the stuff on like MS Word or something, or drawing like MS Paint, you know, how these buildings were laid out. And it was over. I think the documents may have even been saved to the local drive and not even on the network. So, you know, our DMS, their whole thing is, they're gonna take that over for you and distribute all those free plans and stuff to every device. So like, they give you an interface to draw it. They save it for you can access it when you're on your way to the call very quickly. There's just, it's a simple crud app, but that is an amazing improvement to what some of these agencies are working with. So there's just So much room for innovation in the healthcare space. That, you know, things could work a lot better and a lot more smoothly than they currently do.

Rahat Chowdhury  19:14  
Yeah, I'm wondering like, you mentioned before, like ever, things that go into likehealth care, whatever has to be like checked and regulated and all that.Is that probably like a barrier for like a lot of these startups or people who just have these ideas to get in? 

Lee Warrick  19:32  
Yeah, I imagine that. There's definitely some red tape because you got federal regulations like HIPAA that says, you know, if you ever release patient information inadvertently, that's a big deal. You're going to get, you know, federal fines and worse, so I think that there is some maybe fear or anxiety around that, like, well, we don't really want to get into healthcare because, you know, we're dealing with you know, liability for if our things break down, then we get sued, or we could potentially get breached, you know, and have a security problem where we get sued. But at the same time, you've got, like, financial institutions that they're able to iterate on, you know, mobile devices and create apps and stuff for little banks and whatnot. There's a lot of innovation in financial technology, how come that isn't happening in healthcare?There's a lot of money in that space where you can do the things appropriately to them, right. And there's certainly big companies that make medical devices and have those contracts already and are already apprised of like HIPAA and, and all those things, and it's just kind of frustrating to see that they're not making bigger strides to make improvements.

Rahat Chowdhury  20:52  
Yeah. There is definetely like alot of, especially now, with the Coronavirus stuff. Coming out a lot of open source projects people are trying to do you sent me one, I think from Ryan Florence, the whole social distance thing and exponential growth, think like even just stuff like that, you know that stuff that doesn't necessarily link to go directly into the healthcare field, but can kind of stay kind of on the outside of it can probably be helpful.Maybe to have probably, definitely to see more projects like that, that could sort of like, kind of come from the outside and slowly building from there.

Lee Warrick  21:38  
Yeah, I think there's there's a lot of room for opportunity, in that, that category that you're talking about. So that app that you mentioned that Ryan Florence built was kind of educated, educational thing where you would click on there and put in like the ages of members in your household, and it would give you a button to click and it would kind of roll the dice on whether or not one of your family remembers where you would die from Coronavirus if you caught it. And so he would then go from the next screen and like show you, okay, if you contract the disease, here's how many people you're going to infect. And then like, here's the odds that they die. So it kind of shows you the ramifications of what happens if you ignore the social distancing, or decide not to stay at home and go out and party or whatever. Sothat's like a neat, you know, app that he made that probably took him like an hour or two, does a little bit of JavaScript. But the benefit of that and kind of the education that people can get from that is huge, right for the the rate of return on that is pretty massive. And I think that, you know, in the areas around healthcare, even for people that like us that aren't in healthcare, there's a lot of stuff that we can do. So I was thinking, you know, at least as far as education like if you're a nurse, you've got to know A whole lot of different aspects of healthcare like vital signs, labs, being able to read EKGs, all kinds of stuff. So the training for that is like, I've got a bookshelf over here, that's it's full of books like that you just flip through the book and read them. And that's kind of crappy. So what if you had an app where it could show you like, you know, vital signs and ask you, is this good or bad? Is this high or low? Is this patient if they have these vital signs in danger? Or are they okay? stuff like that, it would be easy to build, you know, a little random number generator that has some, you know, some specification built into it. And so, in that direction, I think there's a lot of opportunity for developers out there to create apps like that. And I think they're kind of fun, not just for healthcare providers. Certainly that would be really useful, but also kind of fun for the public to mess around with like, if you've ever been curious about, you know, blood chemistry or something like that you can kind of go through and look at some of those values and maybe learn a little bit about, you know, health care. So I think apps like Ryan Florence's app, maybe like educational apps, stuff like that little quiz games or stuff, it would be a huge improvement, just from my own education when I was going through nursing school, having to use like, a workbook, for instance, with printed EKGs.That's not super useful, because whenever you hooked up to a machine, it's going to show you like a graph in real time with the line going, you know, it's not showing you a static image of an EKG. So being able to animate something in JavaScript, for instance, and kind of tweak in real time, different parameters and like show the person what's a fast heart rate look like? What does a slow one look like? Which is an irregular versus regular hurry look like that stuff. I think Could be super easy to make, and also, like really valuable for a lot of providers out there

Hasibul Chowdhury  25:06  
Thats a very good point that there's so many educational stuff that exists for all these other fields. It's surprising that you mentioned that almost nothing exists for the medical field. And it's one of the fields that requires the most training. You know, Rahat and I have a few friends from high school that just finished med school. Right. We know if you're nurses that took years to get through and it's just it's baffling. how some of the one of the fields that has requires the most education is a little outdated. When there's so many tools that are out there. 

Lee Warrick  25:42  
Yeah, definitely. I have kind of been running that through my head for years. Like why was this stuff so old school like we've got, you know, literally the entire internet in our pockets in a mobile phone. If you go from one hospital to another hospital, the second hospital is not going to get any of the information from the first one. So they're going to ask you over and over again. What medications do you take? What allergies do you have? Tell me about your medical history. I had the misfortune of being in the hospital recently. And, you know, there were like six different providers asking the exact same questions over and over again, because there's no shared system for them, even within the same hospital, to get notes to each other quickly. You know, they're taking paper notes and stuff, so that then later has to be transferred into a computer. And then like, if you dig long enough, you might be able to find it as another provider, but most of them just do their own assessment, and over and over again, you know, like, pester the patient with the same questions. And so it's just kind of baffling, you know, to to be a developer and then also have worked in that field and then go back to that field and kind of look at like, man, is this really what our country is running on? Like, these are the systems that  place for, like life saving care. It can be a little scary at times. 

Rahat Chowdhury  27:06  
Yeah, when you said that I remembered I saw like recently been using zoc dock to like book all my, my doctors, things like that. And in zoc doc they kind of like give you a form to fill out and ask you all those like questions like, you know, do you have any pre existing conditions or do you take meds or whatever? And then so I filled that out, I went to the doctor's office and they asked again, like, but I filled this out, shouldn't you have this in the form that I sent? And like even when they have the technology, they still have to for whatever reason, have you fill out a paper form and then they just put it in the computer and anyway.

Lee Warrick  27:48  
Yeah, it's kind of strange when you think about it. I'm almost think there should be some kind of universal system where, you know if you're an American citizen, And you can have some kind of record that belongs to you kind of like a social security number that has your medical information attached to it. And whenever you go to a hospital, you give them your social or whatever, and they look that up and it's like, boom, this person has been diagnosed with this, this and this. They have these allergies, whatever. Some people might be a little freaked out by that they're like, I don't want the government to know about what kind of medical conditions I have or whatever. Yeah, I mean, like, there's really no hiding some of that stuff sometimes. Like, we could certainly write some smart legislation that says, This information is privileged and no other government systems can look at it or something. It's purely for healthcare. And then imagine like, you go into the doctor's office and tap your phone on a, like a chip reader or something. And it's like, oh, yep, you're this person, boom, they have your medical information. And then you type in your complaint and you're done. Like, why do we have to do this information registry stuff over and over and over again. Talk all these providers and tell them the same story over and over and over again, there's kind of, there's just a lot of wasted time and productivity, right? Like we could be delivering care a lot faster. And if you think about on that direction, if you're delivering care faster, you're wasting less time, you're probably treating more patients might be saving lives by doing something like improving an information, you know, an information management system or crud app, basically, you know, which is a problem that we solve over and over again, as developers, and have just constantly improved on and iterated on. So if you think about applying that to the healthcare field, you could probably save a lot of lives doing something stupid, like making taking somebody's information easier, but we just don't do it as a society. So we just kind of let it go, you know, screw it. We'll just tell the doctor and tell the nurse, tell the CNA tell the next doctor all of this information over and over again. So it's a mess in my opinion.I hate to be negative about it, but there's just, there's so much in that space that that needs work. And unfortunately, like, this whole pandemic situation is just kind of bringing that ugly skeleton out of the closet and putting it on display for the whole country in the whole world. 

Rahat Chowdhury  30:17  
So I guess what some of that experience you've been? You mentioned like that EKG thingof like creating like a Javascript app for that.I remember when we were talking about this, he also shared with me, the med list app that you madefor like your boot camp was some of the stuff thatyou know that you went through at like in the ER as an ICU nurse, some kind of like inspiration for that.

Lee Warrick  30:49  
So my idea was being a nurse like and a medic and all this stuff. It not only bothered me, like from the patient's point of view, but like as a provider That, for instance, if EMs brings in a patient, like we don't actually get any information that they take, aside from what they tell us verbally. So why can't we have some kind of information sharing between the two? And so I thought, well, I can't really solve that as a developer, outside of healthcare. But as somebody that is a patient advocate, I can give the patient something that can make transferring that information easier. So kinda like I was talking about having that centralized way of sharing information, like why not just give it as a third party to the patient. So like, here's an app that you can look up your medications, you can schedule them for yourself. So you can have like a running list of how much you take and when you take it. And as you make it something that you can log into, like, you can do that stuff on your computer and then pull up your phone and log in and then have all the same information. What I found a lot of times as a nurse, and as a medic was patients would have their medications. written down on like a post it note on the fridge or something. And they come into the hospital and they're trying to like recite from memory, whatever they take. And if they're taking more than three or four medications, it ends up becoming kind of a crapshoot. And they just guess, or you're looking at their chart from the last time they were in the hospital and going, do you still take this? Do you still take this? Do you still take this. And again, it's just kind of a lot of wasted time. So I made this app where he log in, add your medication, and then at the same time, add a QR code that it would generate for you. And if you scan that code with your phone, most phones have like a camera app that will read a QR code. And if it's the link take you to that website. So I made it where you can go to the link from that QR code and it would show you the patient's medications and a list with like the frequency and the amount of what they're taking without giving you like their name, birthday or any identifying information so you could print that QR code off Going on business card, make a sticker out of it, or even from your phone access that. And it would show the image of the QR code. And you show that to the provider, they scan it with their phone, boom, they have all your medications, and all your allergies and stuff. So imagine how much time that saves from having to have this long drawn out discussion guessing game with the patient. Do you take metoprolol? Still? Do you still take an aspirin once a day? You know, that's 10 or 15 minutes that you're saving for each provider that you talk to that needs that information, just here it is scan it. And they've got it instantly. Is this up to date? Yeah. So the whole app was kind of in that direction. And again, it's just a crud app, you know, it's up on Heroku. It's free if you want to use it. It doesn't like it skates around HIPAA because it doesn't share any identifying information. When you scan that QR code, it just gives you the list of medications, the amount and like when you take them so Things like that are, you know, low hanging fruit, I guess that are out there that. You know, as developers, we tend to make a lot of tooling for development. I think that's because we're really familiar with the problems and the pain points of development. And so we're like, always have a mind for making the developer experience better. But I think what's awesome about boot camps and career changers is that people like me are coming from under other industries, and they're going, my former industry sucks. And here's all the things I could do to improve that as a developer, like writing a stupid, you know, 10 minute crud app or something.  So I really hope that we get more career changers in the field and that they can kind of turn around and go like, and we can make things a lot better for a lot of people. If we make, you know, a silly app like this, and it gets some traction.

I feel like boot camps give people a chance to voice these problems. already existing in other industries that created with my cohort, there are people that came from like the law background and did like, you know, I wish a law firm had this when I was working there. Or some people came from, like hospitality like, Oh, we wish we had this. So it's like, all over the place. And I'm, you know, I'm glad boot camps are rising up. And then like, people are able to switch careers and come in chairs and have that creative background, and different ideas on how to solve solutions. How to solve problems?

Yeah, definitely. There's, there's so much out there that, you know, you don't have to go out there and make like a food app or whatever. There's a lot of if you sit down and kind of take a step back and think of all the experiences that you've had to deal with as a human right. Education is kind of miserable. Grocery shopping, for instance, like we see a lot of innovation in that space. All of a sudden, you can go on a website and order your groceries. have them delivered to you or go to the local store and pick up a big box full of all that stuff. So there's that that innovation is out there. But we just got to spread it to other industries and kind of, you know, instead of chasing the dollar, right, letting businesses and capitalism or whatever, try and make more money off of technology, we've got a push it, you know, as developers towards improving the lives of, you know, our fellow citizens, friends, family, coworkers, and kind of do some of that innovation ourselves and kind of push the envelope in that direction. And I think that, you know, if we can take a step back from our computers every once in a while and stop writing, like the next JavaScript library or whatever. Maybe we could make some some more interesting applications to do stuff like that.

Rahat Chowdhury  36:54  
So we usually like to wrap up the episodes with a catch up session.What are you doing? I guess like outside of all of this craziness and yeah, how do you how do you spend your time outside of work or anything you do here? 

Lee Warrick  37:10  
Yeah. So you guys probably know that I do a podcast called tech Junior. So every Wednesday we try to release an episode I say try but we have for like the past year, released an episode every Wednesday. Some of them are just Eddie and I talking my co host. Some of them we interview industry professionals or like newcomers to the industry or just anybody in tech, really, that has an interesting viewpoint. So we've talked to Rahat previously about mental health and how that relates to technology. We talked toa whole bunch of people and Travis Nielsen about design we talked to Jason Lengstorf about you know, getting hired and just kind of remember there was a lot of process talk in that one, but it's pretty interesting podcast. I'd like to I think assomebody that makes it. So if that sounds interesting, check that out at Techjr.dev. Also, I run a meetup locally here in Orlando called Project good experience project Codex. So that's kind of been like a safe space for all these people that are entering the industry, coming out of boot camps coming out of computer science programs. You know, you jump into job boards and stuff and you start applying and eat a lot of pushback and a lot of negative feedback from people that are like Oh, your boot camp or whatever, get out of here. So I kind of wanted to make a group and a little community that is welcoming and supportive people that are trying to be career changers.
