Rahat Chowdhury  0:15  
Hi, I'm Rahat. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  0:16  
Hi I am Hasibul. 

Rahat Chowdhury  0:18  
And you're listening to tech for humans. Welcome to a new episode of tech for humans. Today we have Tatiana Mac on our show. Tatiana, you want to introduce yourself a little bit for everyone.

Tatiana Mac  0:30  
Hi there. I'm Tatiana Mac, and I'm a designer and developer currently living in Portland, Oregon, in the United States.

Rahat Chowdhury  0:40  
Awesome. So we brought you on because you do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of really cool things to do with. I know just devs of color, self defined app and style dot CSS. I was looking through like the style dot CSS shop was really cool, I think trying to figure out what They want to get. So, yeah, we wanted to like, kind of divide our time a little bit on those three things. Is there any specific one you might want to start with?

Tatiana Mac  1:12  
Sure. And I forgot to mention that I use both she and they pronouns as part of my introduction. So I think we could probably get started with the dictionary because it's probably the project that I'm focused the most on right now. And it's called self defined. And my hope with a dictionary is to create a place where terms that are evolving to speak about our identities, whether that be in regards to our gender, or ethnicity, or race or religion. There's a place where we can start to articulate some of the nuance, the dictionaries that we all use, I think when we search a word, don't adapt very quickly. I know that the word The singular they which has been around since like the 15th century in English, was something that they just recently added, like within the last year. And so that's a perfect example of how people have been identifying in that way for a really long time. But there's really no place for them to not only see themselves, but then for other people to learn about how those words have impact. And I really think that this project is meaningful for me because I do think that words are really important. They're what define policy. They're what define laws. They're what provide people with a sense of belonging. And so my hope is to create a place where everyone can contribute the ways in which they identify and to help educate the public.

Rahat Chowdhury  2:49  
Awesome. Yeah. Yeah, one thing you mentioned there was like, how the, I guess our current dictionary doesn't have like the singular day until very recently. I think Didn't know that I thought it was just like it was a thing that people just kind of didn't realize. But yeah, that's, that's interesting to know.

Tatiana Mac  3:09  
Yeah. And I think that the other aspect of the dictionaries that we are so used to that are lacking is, I know some of them have API's and can plug into other apps. But I'm hoping to build a really robust API so that these features can start to use automated responses to help educate people, because part of the challenge is that there's a huge burden on people to both self educate and to educate each other. And that's an enormous amount of emotional labor. And if you never know you never know. So perfect example being if API could plug into any chat, app software, it could preemptively say hey, Tatiana, you probably shouldn't use the word crazy because crazy has these ablest connotations. And then it could give me a link out to go read more, and it's That moment, it stops me from harming people by using that word, for example. So that's the part of the technology side that I'm really excited about for this dictionary is it's making it more powerful in helpful ways.

Rahat Chowdhury  4:16  
Absolutely, yeah. Like you mentioning, like, using the word crazy like that, like, I know, I, I definitely use it, just like, you know, as when something is...

Hasibul Chowdhury  4:29  
Someone from New York.

Rahat Chowdhury  4:31  
Yeah. But yeah, I didn't really think about that side of it that, you know, it could do you know, some harm to other people. So that's, I think having an app like that is really good for just like kind of catching those. It's like, things that we say all the time, but we don't think about the impact it has on other people.

Tatiana Mac  4:51  
Yeah, and being able to have something that forces us to slow down I think is really important. It is Doesn't require someone else to do all that emotional labor. And I think that, despite the fact that I think we all want to grow, I think a lot of people, you know, sometimes myself included, we really dislike making mistakes in public. And so this is a way in order to sort of make those interactions private. It's basically like a slack bot or, you know, whatever chat bot telling you, hey, if you don't use that, and you've saved yourself a bit of the embarrassment, and then also learned,

Rahat Chowdhury  5:28  
cool. So right now it exists as like a website are you going to like open up like the API for maybe for it to be used in something like slack bot or something like that.

Tatiana Mac  5:39  
Yeah, that's definitely my hope. So the model right now is both trying to create the web app function, and then also somewhat agnostically, from the web app to create the API so that eventually the web app would itself be using the API to keep the concerns separate. And my hope is that then I can take the API and maybe maintain its open source core so that any not for profit or any open source use for personal use can stay free. But then to charge enterprise level integrations, I haven't decided how to articulate that pricing model yet, but I do want to, in a way as an open source maintainer, reiterate that open source has been somewhat exploited by massive billion trillion dollar corporations. Basically, taking free labor off of people who are doing it for, you know, their own, their own the own good of the community. So I do think that enterprises should be forced to pay.

Rahat Chowdhury  6:42  
Yeah, definitely agree on that. So, um, this project itself, it's open source so people can go on contribute to it. Are you like the sole maintainer or does anyone work with you?

Tatiana Mac  6:58  
Yeah, right now, I would say that My main cohort, fellow maintainer is named Oscar. And he's been really great and helping me to migrate all of this, our main concern right now is to make the web app as contributable as possible. So doing that is removing many layers and barriers to entry. So we've migrated to the static site generator Eleventy. So that folks can do a pull request with the markdown file, basically, and just trying to like take those layers one by one. So of course, that still requires someone to understand how to use git and still require someone to understand how to write in markdown. And so we're looking at the concept of maybe opening open authoring and trying to make it just as like, user friendly and easy to contribute as possible because we don't want to limit the source of contributors to just people that are development savvy. We want to open it up to people have all sorts of technical skill levels. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  8:02  
That's wonderful that I guess even markdown I would consider easier than using like JavaScript or something else to edit. And that's great that you want to move away even from markdown and make it just open authorable. I'm actually on the website right now selfdefined.app and I had a quick question about your design philosophy. What made you want to use like, for example, let's say I'm looking at gender, and the way you have the sub categories under it with like cis fluid. What made you choose that design philosophy to show those words? 

Tatiana Mac  8:35  
Yeah, I think that the hope is to make words as discoverable as possible. So this might be a good example of inheritances or design. So when I first did this, it was an afternoon project. I wanted to figure out how to connect a site to Netlify and then GitHub Pages That was basically like my exercise. And I knew that I wanted to do something that could be helpful, because I spend a lot of time on Twitter and a lot of people don't even know what words they don't know. So this started as literally a list of words. And then I asked folks, what are words that you wish more people knew. And then they started to contribute. And then I was able to update my very simple, one page. list of words from there. The breakdown is that as we start to look at data, which is this is the part that I really geek out about is that when I'm designing the, the interface as it's being generated to the user, I'm also thinking about what are the ramifications on the API side, and how will these terms be served up eventually. So I want to make sure that if someone's looking up gender as a concept, which is a very broad big concept, that eventually that'll serve up all of the sub terms as links or however they're, they're ported. But that if someone looks up cisgender, that should also be linked as a term under the letter C, so that you can have that duality. And also because a lot of those terms when you do break them up into two parts, like cisgender, the word cysts in and of itself has a meaning the word gender has a meaning and then cisgender has its own meaning. So I'm just trying to think about the, the way that the data will be architected. One of the other features that I'm really hoping to develop is that I don't know if you're all familiar with I think it's called pronoun is. Okay, so pronoun is is a helpful site that teaches people essentially about gender pronouns. And so you might see in people's Bios pronoun.is he or pronoun.is, they slash he and The model of that is it. It takes the content from he and the content from day and you can easily have a concatenated URL that's like pronoun.is word slash they plus he, and then that'll generate a page that explains to you how to use those pronouns. Similarly, I would like to be able to use the dictionary to have something like self define.me, for example, forward slash pan for pansexual plus queer. And so then I could put that link in my bio, and that would show you these are the terms that I would like to be identified with. Because part of the thing that I think people get a little tripped up on with gender identity, and well just identity in general is that people don't know what terms other people want to be identified with. And so they do these awkward tiptoey things. This is particularly prevalent when people speaking about disability, that a lot of able bodied people are so uncomfortable with the word disabled, that they say really like messed up terms like differently abled, or like handi capable or all of these really offensive terms that many disabled folks have explicitly said they do not want to be called and that they're very comfortable with the labeled disabled, because they don't see disabled as a bad thing. And there are people that choose to be identified as people with disabilities. And so if in that dichotomy of Well, do you want to be called disabled or people disabilities, nothing replaces a conversation, but that's also a lot of labor. So it would be lovely in my mind to be able to choose to self identify and have a URL that basically concatenates all the terms that you identify with, put that in your bio, and then someone can click on that and see all the terms that you would like to be identified with.

Rahat Chowdhury  12:56  
Wow, that's Yeah, that's amazing. I think Yeah, even, like, I'm not the best with, I guess, figuring out sometimes the things I should or shouldn't say like, I'm on self defined app right now I'm just looking through and I really like the, I guess, kinda like the warning labels, you put on some of those. Some of the words and even now I'm just kind of thinking about them, like I didn't even think about, I've never thought about before, like, how those words can be taken. So something like this is amazing just to have because, and I've seen this a lot with people, like we say certain things, someone may take offense, and then we say, Oh, I didn't mean to do that, or something like that. But I think it's definitely important for us to like, understand why they're not. We shouldn't say that. And try to like, own up to that fact that you know, we're Perfect. We may not know everything, but it's important to understand what other people's feelings are or how other people perceive what we say. So something like this definitely makes it easier a little bit just to understand those things.

Tatiana Mac  14:12  
Yeah, and a lot of what I talk about in my talks is that intent does not erase impact. So the intent of your words and then tend to have your ignorance might be good, but that doesn't remove the bad impact that they have on me. And so the only way we can move forward is more education and more awareness. And I think that a helpful place to tap into is that we all have things about us that we wish more people understood. And so I'm really hopeful that this provides a place for people to share those identifying characteristics.

Rahat Chowdhury  14:46  
Yeah, just reading through some of this. I know at first, when I was first trying to understand a lot of the things that made me a little uncomfortable, but I think that's good. Just to feel that uncomfort that there's something to improve on there that you know, I didn't think about before So, yeah, stuff like this amazing. Thank you for your work on that.

Tatiana Mac  15:05  
Yeah. Yeah, it's great. And I would just, if I can put a plug that if anyone is interested in contributing, there is many ways to contribute. There's, of course writing definitions. We have folks that have started to translate, which is going to teach me a lot about internationalization, which I'm really excited about, and how to handle internationalization in a static site generator. And then also, documentation. I definitely am a huge documentation advocate and our Doc's are there but they definitely could use improvement and love. And also, of course, the code base itself. I've got a lot of folks that are really enthusiastic about working on the API, but there's always like front end needs, accessibility performance design, part of what I'm trying to do, as I call myself, a diseloper, and that Because I'm a designer who really fell in love with development. And so I really want to create space for people that sit in that hybrid. And to integrate them more into build processes like this and to design, you know, components and push them to GitHub and stuff.

Hasibul Chowdhury  16:19  
No, I'm just like going through it. And like you mentioned, I guess this brings back to you know, a lot of stuff when I was reading this just had a flashback to high school. I'm not sure if you had the same flashback, a little background, but Rahat and I met literally first day of freshman year of high school. So we've known each other for like, 15 years.

Tatiana Mac  16:39  
Cute!

Hasibul Chowdhury  16:41  
So it's just like, I'm just even thinking about like, how I've heard these words, or I've used the words. And, you know, obviously, there has been conversations after and I've learned and, you know, I've taught people to just certain words like, you know, us being people of color And just stuff we've dealt with. So I'm just going to this is great. I like if this only existed while we were in high school, or if something like this, or a project like this existed earlier how much like that would have helped? Just this is really wonderful

Tatiana Mac  17:16  
Thanks. Yeah. And I think too speaking about from high school. I think that a lot of what I've learned, and maybe people don't realize this is not something I have always known. I'm in my mid 30s now And so much of this stuff, I just started gaining a curiosity about myself and my own identity in my 30s because I'm, I'm a first gen. Vietnamese American, and both my parents are Vietnamese, and they immigrated here and so being a first gen kid, a lot of people call it third culture kids, and I really identify with that, which is probably a term that I should add. But isn't that idea of understanding? Oh, yeah. I don't really fit in, in America, because I'm not white. And then I don't fit in in Vietnam because they think my Vietnamese is funny. And all the food I eat, while somewhat Vietnamese in origin has been drastically influenced by what was available in the neighborhoods in which I grew up. And so, like everything I experienced is neither here nor there. And so, all of this stuff, I guess, all that to say that I didn't learn a lot about my own identity until a few years ago. And so I'm hopeful that this, you know, gives people education as soon as they can. It's never too late to learn, I guess is what I'm saying.

Hasibul Chowdhury  18:41  
You're right. And you know, what you mentioned about, I guess, you said third culture. You know, I never heard of that term, but I definitely resonate with that. I came here when I was five. So I felt like I grew up here. Every time I go back home. My cousin's my aunt, uncle. They always treat me separately and differently because we know you're not us and I get treated like the here. So it's like trying to create our own space. I think that's a lot of things that people our age and our generation struggle with. And it's great that we're getting to that space and we're starting to have that voice and let it be known, like, Hey, we're here. And we're there for each other. That's great.

Tatiana Mac  19:20  
Yeah, I think that that's one aspect of this is unexpected connections. That's something I've always really clung on to is that being first gen and being third culture, those I connect so much with people from all over the world where we even if we have completely different context for race, socioeconomic class, what states we were moved into how old our parents are how old we are. We have this really weird connection of like parents thinking America is really awesome. I don't know if your parents are like that and I think Just like what? What are you watching? And so there's this identifying characteristics that transcend cultural borders in a way that I think is really lovely and helps to create community and consciousness within a group.

Rahat Chowdhury  20:22  
Awesome. Yeah. So I do want to give some time to a couple of your other projects too. The other one I was also interested in was just maybe this was a good segue into that devs of color. What was kind of the inspiration behind that? Where I saw that you're kind of like compiling sort of, like, almost like a database of like devs who identify as devs of color.

Tatiana Mac  20:50  
Yeah. So the impetus for this project is that again, looking on Twitter when people are like, we need A react developer who can get started on this project, you know, for three months or whatever. And when you look at the replies, it's almost always all white dudes. And because it's like white dudes recommending other white dudes who tag in other white dudes, and is this this vicious cycle and because white men and specifically like American and European men especially are centered within that cycle, that's who gets the job that's whose work gets announced that's who gets promotions. That's who gets there in all these companies. And people don't see that cyclical nature when they're the default setting. And in tech default setting is to be like a white cis hetero dude. And so my hope with this is that whenever someone chimes in and is like, hey, maybe you should consider some white women or people of color candidates or non binary folks, people are always like, where it's a pipeline problem. They're not, you know, around. And that's simply not true. There are so many, like, there are so many folks looking for opportunities. And yet there aren't necessarily great ways to find them. I would say that part of the problem with this whole pipeline myth is that people don't know where to look. And there are some great projects that do that, like Paris Athena's black tech Twitter, like there's definitely places that are creating space. My hope is to bring to light people skills, first and foremost, and it's kind of an interesting model because when you look at a lot of the models that are similar, like there's blacks who design there is People of craft, there's queer design club, there's all of these places where people are being of marginalized communities are being celebrated, which is awesome. They all share one thing in common I notice, which is that most of the time, they're either displaying a photo of the person, or one photo of their work. And with development, I just don't think it quite works the same way. I think that if you're just showing one picture of what you work on, that's having huge front end bias, like something that like looks cool is going to be way better. Or if you're like a front end animator, or whatever. How do you visualize if you're like a really like deep back end developer? You can't. So my hope is to create a database that helps people to sort by the facts. And so things like years of experience, languages that they speak both human and machine languages. What specialties they have. So accessibility, performance, animation, whatever it is, and then what the needs and wants or needs and what they have to offer. So, are you looking for long term contracts? Are you looking for mentorship? Are you looking for full time work? And so making all of the searches a lot more customizable based on the types of things people really need when they're both looking for talent and looking for work.

Rahat Chowdhury  24:35  
Yeah, one of the things you said actually, when you start talking about that, of like, how, yeah, on Twitter, you go when there's, you know, someone posting a job, or whatever. First Person who goes in response as a white dude or tags, another white dude. And I remember like, kind of, I guess, when I started so I started my career in customer support and going through different I guess tech startups and customer support I, at first, I didn't see it, because I was kind of like looking at my own little bubble. pretty diverse. It was, you know, different people of color other people who look like me. And I guess as I started progressing in my career, and then when I started going into shifting over to becoming a developer myself, that's when it really really hit me. And I started to even look back on it from then it was like I was in these call centers. But everyone in like these higher up positions, executive positions, all look the same. And I didn't see it before.

Tatiana Mac  25:39  
Yeah.

Rahat Chowdhury  25:41  
Until I guess really trying to progress in my career and look at different things that I wanted to do and yeah, it's a lot of times when you're trying to get these positions like people will just, you know, recommend people other people will look like them. Yeah, something like this. Definitely. With that,

Tatiana Mac  26:00  
Yeah, like I think that if things are reversed, like if folks who are used to being the default came into a workplace where they were the only white person over and over and over again, I think that they would start to understand at least they wouldn't be able to understand the full experience by any means. But they'd be able to understand like, Wow, I've had so many jobs where I was the only person who looks like me, so many. And I think all three of us have quite a bit of relative privileges in that being Asian and I'm assuming South Asian like, we have or I should say, Southeast and South Asian. We're all Asian. But yeah, I think that that concept of like, even we are fairly well represented within tech, I mean, I can start to splice hairs about how East Asians are the most are what people assume I am and I'm not and Southeast Asians aren't represented but that's a whole other conversation.

Hasibul Chowdhury  26:55  
I was gonna say like, you're right, like Asian people. I think it's Very easy for all of Asians as a whole to break into tech. Just because of the connotation, we have, like, Oh, you know, your asian, you must know, you must be really good at this. And I've dealt with that a lot. And it makes it easier for us to break into tech. And one thing I've noticed, though, I guess from the bubble I'm in or just what I've seen, however, like other communities are actually better about grouping together and coming and creating more of a welcoming background or community, let's say black people in tech, or even latinos in tech. I feel like they come together and create a more of a welcoming community for people like them to break into tech. We know Rahat, and I know quite a few people that were actually at an afro tech conference earlier in 2019. And I'm like, that's so cool that you know, They have that they're having a conference and to bring it but like, I don't see any Asian or Southeast Asian communities holding big conferences and you know, creating an open forum for people like us.

Tatiana Mac  28:16  
Yeah. And I think that that's part of the any, there's a few things to unpack there, which is one is that I think because that idea of Asian diaspora is so large, and there are so many cultures being represented, we are experiencing like to be able to connect on that realm. We haven't figured out I think, as a community how to do that. Right, like even that distinction when we talk about South Asian versus southeast versus East Asian versus Central Asian, that is so many cultures being represented, and I love to compare it to Europe because Europe is significantly smaller in terms of population and area. Yet, Europe has like just as almost as many countries as we do in Asia. And so and same with Africa. And so when you look at that you're like, wait, so we can distinguish like as a globe, the difference between France and Germany and Czech Republic and Greece, yet ask any person to name more than like five Asian countries and many of them are going to be stumped especially in the US. And so I think that we have experienced this like cultural flattening. I love to make shit posts one of them especially about how like, we talked about Asian food. Why not European food, like why don't your friends ever be like, Yo, I love European food. Right? Like you would say, I like french food or I like Italian food, you know, you would give it its regional origin, but people all the time like I love Asian food, and then they give me some dish. That's like four PF changs and I'm like, that's not really like an Asian dish and what country does that come from? I have no idea. So, yeah, I think we have cultural flattening issues. I also think that the second and more difficult thing to reconcile is that many Asians are very content with bolstering and supporting white supremacy because they have the relative privilege to hide behind our light skin. We have the privilege to for those of us who have light skin, and then we have the privilege to almost fall back on this horrible minority model minority myth, which I personally hate because yes, I happen to be really good at math. That's just because I as an individual love math. I happen to play piano, I begged my parents to let me play piano. So I fall into a lot of the stereotypes, but then there's a lot that I don't fall into. And especially the one about being like obedient and quiet, and that's not me. That myth is really something that really hurts us. It's given us a lot of privileges. And I think it really hurts us.

Rahat Chowdhury  31:07  
One thing you had brought up of, like, you know, having our privilege of like those of us who are like lighter skin, I didn't really think about this like before, but even like, when I was younger, I remember relatives and family members would call me like, the white Rahat or whatever. It's just because I had, you know, lighter skin than other brown people. And at first, like, I didn't think too much of it. I thought they were making fun of me, but a lot of them wanted that because, you know, they feel like, you know, that makes it easier to, I guess, get through our current world or community or whatever. And I started Yeah, really understanding that I guess later in life. Just made me think about that when you brought that up here too. Yeah, even within our communities, we're always like looking at lighter skin as like This is better thing for people or better for us.

Tatiana Mac  32:03  
Yeah, I mean, you have to think about media, right? Like in media all across the globe, I would say that lighter skin is prioritized and having done some work in, like video recording and in photo shoots, like so many people don't know how to light for light or darker skin. And, you know, it just all is a vicious cycle. There's just, I know speaking for my own upbringing, that to look like certain East Asian races was preferred to looking like Southeast Asian or which is what I am, or looking like other you know, Southeast Asian races and or folks and I, I just think that that's such a clear example of how the lighter skinned and the more conventionally attractive you are by Western ideals. So like a high nose bridge, a small nose, being tall. All of these things are, like infiltrated not only into our childhoods, and like what our Auntie's say to us when we have like a family gathering all the way to like the media. No, seriously, remember? Like, it's just like, where you're like, Okay, let me just endure some casual racism from my own Aunts.

Hasibul Chowdhury  33:25  
I mean, this. Yeah, I don't know how many times I've heard that. I'm just like, Oh, I can walk away. Walk away right now.

Tatiana Mac  33:33  
Yeah, and it's like, you know, you do what you can to say things your relatives and to try to educate them. But it's so insidious and so prevalent to the point where it's almost a part of the culture is to value being fair skinned and yeah, it all comes down to colorism and anti blackness.

Hasibul Chowdhury  33:55  
I was gonna say maybe we should shift to a little lighter note here. Since it Got a little heavy. But like just talking about like maybe style dot css like, I just love the website, they go on a rod show me there's a couple of weeks ago, I just couldn't stop laughing at all the shirts. I think it was like in the middle of my boot camp. So I spent an hour going around to all my cohort mates. I'm like, Guys, you have to see this. And I know, they got mad at me because I disrupted them they were coding. But like, that was like the first thing, "go away", and then I made them look at it and like, Oh, this is awesome.

Tatiana Mac  34:28  
That's great. That gives me inspiration. Like I've kind of put it on hold for a bit, trying to focus on the dictionary, but every once in a while just like get this idea in my head and I'll just be like, Alright, I'm making it. And it's really, like, it's just fun. I just wanted something that took like, I do a lot of shit posting on Twitter. And I was like, You know what, like, I might as well use it to do some good. So for every item that I sell, I donate a portion to several organizations. So the first one being the main one that I donate is Black Girls Code, I think it's such a cool organization. I just every time I watch, like anything that they put out, it's like, they just do such incredible stuff. And I think that it reminds me of the joy of figuring out how to do stuff. And like kids, I don't know if you ever watch kids code, but they're such better pair programmers then we are they're like, are helpful. They're not dicks about it. They're like, excited to like work together. And so I just think it's such a cool organization. So most of the donations funneled through to there. And then I also donate to the Trevor Project, which is for LGBTQIA+ folks, teams especially. And then also, I also donate to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. Because so many Indigenous women and children go missing every year and it's something that we completely ignore. And then I also donate to the Racies, which is an organization that works with undocumented immigrant families that are basically being treated horribly at the border. So they provide legal aid and reunification resources. To those families that have had that horrible thing happen to them. 

Rahat Chowdhury  36:27  
Do you usually, maybe like try to tailor some of the products to be somewhat in theme with whoever you're donating to?

Tatiana Mac  36:37  
Yeah, definitely. So for example, like if I'm ever using anything that I believe comes from Black American culture, so if it's using anything that is like descendant or directly from African American vernacular English or AAVE and I make sure those donations funnel to Black Girls Code And then for any that are like playing off of I mean I identify as queer myself, but any that are playing off of like sexuality. So I have one that's Bitechtual. And it's because I shit post that you can love both JavaScript and CSS. And for those folks, they're Bitechtual. And for people who don't care what program that they code in, or what language they coded, they're Pantechtual. And so it's like a double entendre and teaching people about what those terms mean. And so I tried to donate those proceeds to the Trevor Project. So yeah, I do try to theme it as much as I can. But then for ones that are just like, not connected, that I just try to evenly distribute them through the organizations that I'm trying to support. So last year, I think I donated about $600, which isn't like the most money in the world, but I for my first year, I was pretty excited about that.

Rahat Chowdhury  37:59  
Yeah. This still awesome like being able to donate proceeds from that. It's really cool.

Tatiana Mac  38:04  
Yeah, it's just like a nice thing to give me some income stabilization. And also, I just feel like it. I get so much joy when someone like shows me that they wear their shirt to give a talk or like, you know, to give a presentation at work or something. And I just makes people laugh. And I think it reminds people that code is not that serious.

Rahat Chowdhury  38:26  
Yeah, there was one shirt I think I really liked. I think it was hero worship kills community. That was like one of my favorite ones off there. I remember, like when I first started, I guess trying to transition into being a dev. One of the first things I did was going on to Twitter and like following a bunch of people who were like, I guess, thought leaders in tech or whatever and or Twitter famous pretty much Twitter famous. And it was like, yeah, these people are doing really awesome things. I want to be like them. And I guess as I started, like, kind of following more people thinking about it more, I'm just like, Yeah, but some of them are not really the best, I guess. people to follow. And yeah, when the first time I saw that, shirt. And I was like, yeah, that reminded me of that a little bit of like, when I was starting off, sometimes we just kind of like look at people who seem super successful. And yeah, we want to be like them. Disregarding like, anything else that they might be doing or might not be doing for community. So that's definitely really cool. I like that your, you know, your apparel kind of like, makes you think about things like that.

Tatiana Mac  39:54  
Yeah, thanks. I think that the aspect of that that a lot of people don't realize is that Heroes, you know, the people that we often think of as being like the favorites, and really well known in tech and really likable people that create a lot of really amazing content. I think that's kind of the unifying factor that I've seen from people that become like, truly known in the dev community is people that put out a lot of helpful content. That's what they do at the end of the day. And that, to me, is the stewardship of community. Like they're creating documentation. They're creating cool examples, they're pushing on the technology. So yeah, we should definitely be complementary about their work. But I think at the end of the day, we forget that these people are really human, and many of them have some really questionable ethics. And that like, it benefits us none to worship them. And the reason I created the shirt was because I saw at that point in my life that people's heroes were kind of falling, if that makes sense. So they were Either had said or done something that had been not good. And people naturally, when they're heroes, do something like that they don't know what to do. They kind of feel at a loss a bit. And and I think it's because they've almost aligned their North Stars to these people's career trajectories because they too want to emulate what they've done. But that's so dangerous that you're like hinges on someone who is just as equally likely to make mistakes as any of us are. And so my hope in creating the shirt is to remind people that heroes are not the end all be all, and we shouldn't really make heroes we shouldn't identify people in our community as heroes. And then to that, like community is really where we need to focus and community maintains its ideology, it maintains its work it maintains its motivations. Even when individuals misstep within the community and part of community is holding one another, accountable to the ethics, and to the work, and to the missions that we've all set out, and I think that's what we need to ultimately protect.

Rahat Chowdhury  42:17  
Yeah, definitely. Is there any shirt or thing you made on there that you liked a lot? Or is your favorite?

Tatiana Mac  42:28  
I think it's one of the most underrated is my async shirt that's done. And it's such a throwback. It's a fun throwback for me because Mandy Michael, who's one of my dear friends, she and I met at a conference and we got started talking in how we started learning how to code and, you know, like things like Neopets and Myspace basically having our millennial nostalgia as we love to do and we learned we each maintained rival web rings for insync and Backstreet Boys. So she's a huge Backstreet Boys fan, and I actually am too.

Hasibul Chowdhury  43:09  
Yup Rahat and I are too!

Tatiana Mac  43:12  
yeah, that's great. Well, I was the maintainer of a substantial nsync web ring and I had this website nsync2000. net that was coated in frame source sets, and it was great. And anyway, so I love this because it whenever I have to use async I always start thinking like in nsync songs. Like, I could delete something and I'm like, Alright, bye, bye, bye. So yeah, that's just one of my favorites. And I feel like my favorite thing is just taking like to weird niche things and putting them together. So yeah, that one's the most underrated to me. Not very many people buy that one, but it's fine so much of this is just me wanting stuff that I want to wear. So I just make it and like maybe someone else wants to wear it.

Hasibul Chowdhury  44:05  
The one question I think we've asked is is like, how do you have time for all of this.

Tatiana Mac  44:10  
So I'm very privileged in that I work independently. So I have a very, I would call it both very rigid and very loose schedule. And up until all of this stuff started happening with COVID-19. I was speaking a lot. And so I basically structure my weeks in the same way every week. So Monday, I do all my administrative work. I don't really email much on days outside of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, I do what I consider conceptual work. So if I need to do some UX work for a site, or if I need to map out like the infrastructure for one of the projects, I do that, and then Thursday, Friday, I do like very Implementation base work. So I'm just like, like hands to keyboard coding, or illustrating or designing like stuff that requires, in my mind very little like active brain work. It's very much like lizard brain like, okay, that component is here. How do I trace that back? That kind of framework. And then I sort of repeat that schedule over and over every week. And it somehow gets everything done. But yeah, part of that is that I'm not tethered to the nine to five life. So I don't like some days I might work like an 18 hour day, and then some days, if my mental health isn't great, I don't work because I'm not going to be effective. And that's certainly a huge privilege that I have of working independently. But I think it makes me a lot more effective with my time.

Hasibul Chowdhury  45:50  
That's great. I felt like if I left to my own devices, I would just never leave the bed. watch Netflix, Anime, never leave the bed.

Tatiana Mac  46:01  
I mean, there are days like that. But I think that at some point, like, things have a forcing function, right? Like when you're laying in bed and you're watching anime, and you're like getting your reminders for your bills, and you're like, Oh, yeah, if I don't work, I don't get any money, which is a hard shift. I think for a lot of folks who are used to being salaried, because like, stop being salaried forces you to go to work. And then you always have a paycheck. While you're salaried. For me, it's like, if I don't work, then I'm not going to get paid.

Rahat Chowdhury  46:31  
We usually like to wrap up our episodes with like a catch up session. What are you doing outside of, you know, the work that you do here we like to do for fun? How are you holding up in this social isolation world that we're in right now?

Tatiana Mac  46:47  
Yeah, um, so I just adopted a dog. Her names Arwin she's a senior German Spitz and she's taking up a lot of my time and forcing me to go on to go outside. I you do a lot of reading. And I just downloaded Animal Crossing, which means that's going to be occupying all of my time when I'm not working and set it on my island. So if anyone wants to come visit my island, I couldn't think of what to name it. So I named it JC Penney, and now I learned I can't change it. So that's, that's my island, JC Penney, but yeah, so I like video games. I love making art. So that kind of ties in with like my style dot CSS. I love to draw. I have a lot of plants. I'm a very good millennial. I like all the things I'm millennials like,

Rahat Chowdhury  47:40  
Yeah, I think definitely wanna download Animal Crossing myself after this. I was playing. Another game was called. Wow, I can't remember what it was called. And I play this all the time, too.

You talking about Stardew? How do you forget? How do you forget Stardew?

Tatiana Mac  48:07  
If you I feel like they're connected like I don't think that Animal Crossing is as intense as Stardew in terms of like what you have to maintain and it gets a little bit lighter. Stardew I think got really intense. But Animal Crossing is have you played it before? It's just so delightful. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  48:28  
I have you seen a lot of people play it I just somehow never got into it. It was more I guess like Pokemon and like a few action games.

Tatiana Mac  48:39  
It's it's slow paced, which I love. And I just love that you're basically everyone's personal assistant on the island. You're like, you know, like the, the tour guide director will be like, go find me this. Like Okay, I'll go for you this I just like I don't know. kinda nice and I think that to kind of in a roundabout answer your question about how I'm doing I think that, as silly as it is, I think Animal Crossing is a lovely reminder of community. And how that game really like teaches us to be helpful neighbors to one another. And yeah, it's just cute and silly and I think it's hilarious.

Hasibul Chowdhury  49:23  
I think half my Facebook feed is just like people like I just got Animal Crossing. I'm here my daughter and I she's home for like the next five weeks and she's like, Dad, can you play that racing game? She won't let me play anything else besides Mario Kart with her so as soon as I switch to something else, like no, no, I don't like this. Like I can't even get any other game in.

Tatiana Mac  49:46  
Someone that I'm Mutual's with on Twitter said that their child was doing the same thing that they had to keep their child off of Mario Kart so that they could play Animal Crossing. I think it's such a funny thing about our generation is that My parents played video games with me. I think that they entertained me and certainly my dad like a lot more than my mom. But I feel like our generation and those of us who don't have kids, but for those of us who have kids, I think it's really interesting because like, so often, buying that new video game is not necessarily for them.

Hasibul Chowdhury  50:20  
I think, like, all these games I'm buying right now. I'm like, yeah, it's for her, no it's for me.

Rahat Chowdhury  50:30  
My mom was just like, when you have kids, are you gonna just be playing video games? But what about them? Are you gonna buy them video games? And I think I straight up told her on time like no they need to get their own those are mine.

Tatiana Mac  50:48  
Gosh, I think like the weirdest thing as an aside, is that video games are the same price as when I was a kid. Video Game prices have not changed like I remember I paid 74 dollars for an SNES game. That's bananas. That's so much money and I just paid 59.99 for Animal Crossing like why haven't the prices changed? Why are they the same is I don't know what they should be I don't know if they should be cheaper or more, but it doesn't make any sense isn't it

Hasibul Chowdhury  51:20  
There's such a bigger market now too for games

Tatiana Mac  51:24  
Yeah, yeah. And digital downloads I guess back then you they like printed you up this like nice little book. And you know you had the like, cartridge and I don't know for some reason that it's physical makes it feel more valuable.
