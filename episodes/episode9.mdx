Rahat Chowdhury  0:15  
Hi, I'm Rahat. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  0:17  
Hi I am Hasibul and you're listening to tech4humans.

Rahat Chowdhury  0:22  
Welcome to Tech4humans. Today's guest is Daniel Adeyanju. Daniel, can you tell us a little bit about yourself? 

Daniel Adeyanju  0:27  
Sure how you doing everyone? Um, first of all, thanks so much for having me on. My name is Daniel Adeyanju. I do a few different things but I think it all goes under this umbrella of being a tech and inclusion and innovation strategist. So I'm all about having more people at the table of innovation. How do we create opportunities for everyone to be part of creating this future underneath that I have a company called be great today. And I consult with various projects that align with that. So for example, I've been working with children's aid to expose high school seniors to technology. So we're hoping that some of them will, will go into careers in computer science or majors in computer science, ultimate careers in computer science. And I'm helping start a nonprofit teaching cloud technology, starting with folks in the Bronx, and because Rona is probably gonna start online, so that might change geographically. But we're all adapting and trying to have impact. So really great to be here on tech for humans with the two of you.

Rahat Chowdhury  1:34  
Awesome. So fun fact, if you've been listening to this podcast, you'll know that Hasibul and I went to high school together. Daniel was actually also in our graduating classes. 

Daniel Adeyanju  1:46  
oh nine so fine. It seems like so long ago. 

Rahat Chowdhury  1:50  
It does. Another fun fact. Daniel was in a rival rap group from the one I was in and we had a lot of beef.

Daniel Adeyanju  2:00  
I was reflecting on that. I'm like, wow, that's it's so interesting how that is to hip hop. It's like this contention, right? We're like, the only ones doing it. And it's like, hey, but I'm a rapper. It's like, that's that spider man meme? It's like, Hey, man, like, great times. It's amazing how we've all converged around technology. So being music files, I can't really find intersection between music and technology in the creation. Absolutely. 

Rahat Chowdhury  2:24  
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I remember when I like, started getting into code or technology or whatever. There's a ton of like, former musician slash developers, and it's crazy to me how like common it is, like people come from like different creative backgrounds into technology.

Hasibul Chowdhury  2:50  
Yeah, I just want to talk about how you sorry Daniel, but I want to talk about how you guys glossed over your fake beef. You guys had real beef, but it was fake the time you guys scripted everything

Daniel Adeyanju  3:05  
It was so long ago I just remember, it was just like two musicians like we did performances and things like that. Um, but yeah, like all those all those experience I actually still have it on my I have it on my LinkedIn like under Bronx science. I'm like I had a rap group. still one of the most interesting things about me, which I hope I can find other interesting things to develop, but it was it was a great time. What about you Hasibul? Were you into music at all?

Hasibul Chowdhury  3:29  
I mean, I listen to music but never like creating music. I took that. I forgot that class we took. We took music creation or something

Daniel Adeyanju  3:39  
I remember we had to come up with a song. Oh my gosh, that's Yeah, I remember that. We actually had to come up with a song. It's so crazy. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  3:47  
And I ended up just putting random stuff together and I got a 95 on the test. I don't know how. So like, that's as far as my music creation goes. But I love listening to music. 

Rahat Chowdhury  3:58  
I think a couple people paid me to make beats for them to submit for like a final project for that class. Yeah. 

Daniel Adeyanju  4:05  
Oh, are you in the music production class with the like, with your digital music class? And everything? Oh, you were Yeah, music. I was in regular music theory. So I don't know how to get into those cool classes like I just did like all the regular stuff. Um, but that's dope that yall did did like the music production class. That's pretty cool. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  4:24  
Yeah, I think that was my first time I actually touched a MIDI keyboard. I was like, Wow, that's pretty cool.

Rahat Chowdhury  4:29  
Cool. Awesome. So yeah, the reason we brought you on we want to definitely talk about some of the things you've touched on when you introduce yourself a little bit. We can start maybe witthe company that you started you said I think be great. 

Daniel Adeyanju  4:44  
Sure. Yeah, be great today and I'll go one step further a step backwards to just tell you about my story because I kind of jumped into where I'm at now but who I am today is a function of all the things please have been that led up to this and even like high school was, um, was kind of like this, in a sense, a second step like I was actually into coding and into technology prior to high school, I grew up in a household where my dad is into network, like kind of the hardware stuff. I didn't really take to that as much. I really took the technology and applications whether using them, or trying to create them and write like a c++ application, it would crash. And I'll just be like, I don't want you to go to to ask questions. So early on, I had this fascination, but I had no way of going beyond kind of the basics that I could get from books. I was also easily learning about other things. I'd be like, coding and the next day, I'd be like, trying to do animations, um, nothing really working. But I was very, I was always always exploring ways to interface with technology. When I went to science, it was just like, Alright, Yo, this is hard. I have no time. I can't do nothing. Um, so they actually like set me back in terms of advancing technology. I didn't even apply for it to computer science class. Like I said, I didn't really venture out and try to take advantage full advantage of science at the time. And I was kind of in this immigrant mode of umm doctor, lawyer engineer, and I'm like, um, well, I don't really know what a lawyer I mean, I know lawyer like I see it on TV, but I'm pretty sure it's not what they actually do seem boring as hell engineering didn't really appeal to me in the sense of like, electrical the standard eliquis Engineering Building Bridges, civil engineering, those disciplines didn't call out to me. Um, computer science didn't really emerge as a thing to me, to be honest with you like it was just like, Oh, I know computers, but I don't think if it just wasn't in the world, it wasn't in my purview of things you could do or should do, right? Um, so the default was medicine, right? I want to help people and this is a lifelong kind of thrust everyone encouraged Oh, you want be a doctor. That's great. Because I mean, people don't want to die. So they want their friends to be doctors. So I went to college. majored in biology. Initially, well, almost four years thinking, alright, I'm gonna do biology do med school, I'm realize at some point, hey, I actually hate biology classes. I don't really want to take all these classes to become a doctor. Ultimately, there's so many other ways to help people. And I kind of stumbled into technology through a good friend of our mutual friend of ours, Jake, who were still really close till today, started on. He started that transition while in college, like starting to work on projects in tech. And he kind of made real cuz I've been hearing about startups, but he was kind of made it real like I work in a place with startups. So he made that intro got my first job in tech, running operations and product for an online food ordering company. So after college, I spent almost two years two years plus just like absorbing and understanding the industry, understanding how startups work, understanding I have felt super blessed. And this is where Inclusion innovation comes in, I felt super blessed to just be in the room. Like this world, I had no idea about, I saw nobody else like me, no very few black folks were in the industry. It was it was very, very, like, different from what I've been seeing in college, right. In college, you only hear about the kind of typical career paths, um, and it's very unclear what you can do. But like I suddenly saw all these opportunities to create your own products improve people's life. So while I was there, I was like, my CEO is a programmer, but my CTO was a programmer, CS backgrounds. I was like, Well, I guess I gotta be a programmer to be able to, like really operate in this field and a second bachelor's in computer science at Lehman College in the Bronx. While working I started while working up into the last two semesters, and I also did a second I also did a bootcamp. I'm in the first of the last two semesters after I left the online food ordering company. I started to realize that like mobile development, is where everything is going. So that's why I did a mobile development Bootcamp, it's no longer in progress. It was at Flatiron School, which is still around and doing great. But that combination of CS back on iOS domain specific knowledge, that means my first role as an iOS developer for macys.com, which is on the west coast. So Macy's, the retailer and I didn't know this at the time that yo everybody needs technologists. I kind of intuited it, and I knew is a great way for me to have flexibility about where I work and things I do. But when I applied for Macy's, like I didn't really understand, like, I couldn't really conceptualize like, they had, like, hundreds of developers behind this app. That like our mom's use, right. Um, so I actually moved to the west coast was in California. I'm doing this work as an iOS developer. Um, frankly, didn't love it. Like didn't even Like it, frankly, like there's parts that I enjoy in terms of coding, I enjoy the problem solving aspect. You know, yada yada, yada, all those things that you should enjoy. But But I think I'm more interested in in how the app actually impacts people's lives, the end, not so much the process of actually doing it. Um, and a part of that, for me is making sure that the people that are building the apps reflect the diversity of the world, especially black Latino folks that are most underrepresented in the field and women. So I spent it I started spending a lot of my free time helping students navigate because I noticed that like folks would go to school even when I was at Lehman and also Binghamton folks who go to school, studied computer science or studied something else, and just have no idea how to get to their next route. So that brought me to this world of becoming a career coach, which took me to Lehman College. I spent some time there helping students get jobs. But and while I was doing that, I was also putting on events bringing people together around technology and innovation. And I'm at a point I was really interested in going on my own seeing what that would be like. So I've been spending the past year running various programs and exposing folks to pathways into technology. So I'd say that's been my last year and the x years prior to that.

Rahat Chowdhury  11:23  
Awesome, that's a lot of stuff. Especially, that's, that's awesome that you are kind of like going through and trying to figure out like ways to bring about even like the diversity inclusion aspect of things like even on your free time. I think I remember, like, I remember weird things sometimes. And I think you posted on LinkedIn one time about like how people like, especially from like immigrant families, when we're in school, we don't really know what, at what point we're supposed to like. actually be applying to internships or whatever. And I thought about that. And I went back I was like, Yeah, I, when I was kind of like going through that phase, I had no idea that we should be applying for summer internships in the fall. That seemed like a weird, really weird concept to me. Yeah, then like, especially people from like immigrant backgrounds like us, like, we have no idea that this is a thing. No one's really telling that to us. So, yes, I guess it's stuff like that kind of like what you're incorporating in your career coaching for folks? 

Daniel Adeyanju  12:33  
Oh, 100%. And I think I am glad that some that's a that's like one of the things that you remember about and I think it's a great example of where I how I see myself in the ecosystem. I'm a connector, a connector of people. I'm a connector of ideas on whether they're connecting ideas between each other and that's what creates innovation. Innovation isn't just coming out something out of the blue. It's about combining old knowledge, bringing into new forms on creating new knowledge as a result. Right. So, um, and making sure that people have access to that information. So that's what I'm really doing. Like, there are a lot of people for which that process of internship is, like, ingrained in them. And I'll give you an example of why that might be right. So somebody who has been in this country for generations, in terms of their family, they are simply following a blueprint that's already been set up for them right. Now, immigrant parents have have come from a different environment, they have that blueprint of how to survive in that environment. assumably and then they come into this new environment, that blueprint may not work exactly the same way. I mean, what are the blueprints and that immigrants try to often default to is to become a doctor, you're indispensable. Um, and you will be able to thrive become a nurse, you'll be able to survive, you become, um, you know, in many contexts, I think law is a prestige in engines we raise a class of a family and then you can go and you're indispensable that society engineering, I believe my theory around that is that just like makes you mad smart and you're a problem solver. So, like, back home, you can at least go and like fix things and provide four your family that way. Inside of those core professions, there's a lack of awareness of what those opportunities are, that you need to plan ahead for. Right? There's a whole spectrum of job but you kind of jump into like government jobs, like you can take a test and All right, great, your family's taken care of forever. That's another pathway, less prestigious, but it's like, oh, you know, great, like, at least you know, you got money coming in safely umm these new careers or new work careers in technology, business consulting, these kinds of fields. It's more amorphous. This is knowledge work, the future of work, being that kind of knowledge work and it's harder to navigate. It's harder to know I need to apply almost a year in advance for that role. Now if someone tells you that, that gets you somewhere Another thing is for you to see it. You need to see things to believe it if my older sibling and my cousin and my uncle has done that pathway I now believe it for so for my part of my responsibility is to be the example that others can see when I did the boot camp when I did school seems like a lot. And I just saw it as like when I'm setting up my ability to be able to do this work sustainably because I gotta be able to eat. But also, I can always tell somebody coming down the line, you can do it because I did it too. So that's how I think about it. Like how you connect people the right information, give them examples of how it's being done, whether that's myself or someone else in my in my network. I'm, I'm really just encourage people to be great. That's where the name comes from. Like I want to challenge others to be great and greatness is helping others be great. And that's why I love the name of your podcast. Tech for humans for a while, that was my tagline on LinkedIn like tech is for the people. And I just did a post recently that got us some engagement where it's like, let's not forget that technology has been around since beginning of time. Talking about fire talking about wheels, technology. And now we're talking about intersecting knowledge. This is the most radical change in technology ever. And it's a multi has a multiplier effect. So whatever technology you're building, you need to build it in service of people. And if you're building something in service of people, you need to talk to them, you need to know what they need, and constantly make sure that you're improving their lives. So I'm all about tech for humans. And so you and you asked me for about so be great. I think I touched on that. And I think that has a lot of my various projects. I'm also really proud of having started at home in a sense, and I'd say a lot of what I do would be great today. it overlaps very seamlessly with A volunteer organization, I started with my alma mater. So and I like to talk about this with people of all backgrounds. And I think it's a point of connectivity to a lot of other things. So folks will also realize that a lot of the times, I my focus is on black and Latino folks trying to enter the field. And I also think a lot about women trying to enter the field, I actually think the most about black women entering the field black and Latina women, right? So when we think about inclusion, and you know, we can take it to a broad like, I it's a very, it's a tendency for some people very naturally, like, if I'm talking about black folks, folks will be like, you know, well, what about everybody else? Right? And it's kind of like, it's this weird thing where people may perceive it as like, Am I saying they're racist, or am I saying that black people should get all the jobs for anyone because of all that, um, but what I'm really saying is this is a group that is really been disenfranchised and You know, when we talk about wealth, which is this concept of accumulated financial reserves in a sense of value that's been accumulated generations on black and Latino groups are the least likely to have that in America due to a lot of structures, right? So we can talk about the immigrant story, which I'm an immigrant. I'm a black immigrant. So my story is different by design, because because of having come to this country, but my kids aren't going to be American, right? They can be black American, they're gonna not they're gonna be indistinguishable. So they will have the same challenges. And whether you've been here for generations, or you just got here as a black person, there's still this challenge of, of developing generational wealth, and I believe that tech is a route for many people to develop, to develop that generational wealth. So by focusing on blacks and Latinos and women and the intersection between of that I hope to be able to increase access for everyone. Because if the group that has the most discriminated against is able to be a part of the picture, and they're also thinking about inclusion, everyone should be a part of this shared story of building a more collective prosperity, which is, which is like, I mean, you know, there's so much money out here in the world, like, everyone can have a bit a decent standard of living, everyone can have access to education, everyone can have access to health care, we just need more of our leadership. And to some extent, I don't know this word technical leadership, right? All these tech companies making so much money, if they have the orientation, to improve access for other people, and use that imagination to create opportunity, I think the sky's the limit. Same way that you know, we can figure out how to get to the moon, I think we can figure out how to feed people here on Earth.

Hasibul Chowdhury  20:00  
Very well said, you know, especially with what everything's happening now with Coronavirus. You just think tech is just stepping up and they're creating solutions. And it's about time someone's like something kicked their butt to get them in motion and this is great. 

Daniel Adeyanju  20:15  
Yeah, man, I mean the word you use there which always we kick it to death right? problems on the right problem solving should not be the reserve of the bootcamp grad. Right. The the computer science major, the, the engineer, right, like problem solving should when I talk about innovation inclusion, I'm seeing that every child should grow up thinking, hmm, here's a problem. I need to I have it within me, in my mind in my heart to solve this problem in collaboration with other humans. Education fundamentally has to change from rote memorization. learn this, learn that spit it back to me. I mean, you know, that stuff like encourages Cheating encourages people to kind of find shortcuts But no, you actually solve a problem with something around you with something you don't like. solve that problem create, write? Paint, rap. Like I remember an example of problem solving intersection with intersecting with um, music was and I have this add I've kept this paper though from from science. I had a class it was English class with Miss Buchanan. Anybody remember Miss Buchanan? Bucan not Buchanan. So she was my English teacher in junior year. And I'm in I'm in a group with Jake and Eme  look at the odds of course.And we had an assignment 

Rahat Chowdhury  21:43  
For reference Jake and Eme were also both rappers 

Daniel Adeyanju  21:46  
Yes. Yes. They were both of my my rap group and Jake is is Gentlemen, I mentioned who from the jobs still good friends working together and a couple things now. Our teacher had get assigned us to tell a story. I don't remember Medium she expected or what the what the parameters were like to convey some sort of idea about the roaring 20s if you remember the roaring 20s it's like, when the great The Great Gatsby, if you ever saw that movie or read the book, it's about this like really gilded time when people are just wiling, like they're just conspicuous consumption is just like imagine everybody's a rapper, basically. So, I mean, that's literally my thought process. I'm like, yo, so basically, you're telling me that everybody's a rapper in this time, and I rap so I'm gonna do a rap for this homework assignment. And that's what we did. I remember her first response, I gotta check in with Jake because like, her response that she kind of she because I don't think she knew or maybe we were conveying to her. Then we did a presentation or presentation was the song with a breakdown of the lyrics and the context and all that and she was aghast she was just confused. Um, and, but but like, maybe a day or so later, or whatever to back the assignment, we got like a 95. And she was like, gushing, like, Oh, this is so great. Like, I love this, that. And the third, I don't know what changed in that span of time. Um, but that was an example of we were given a problem to solve a task. And we pulled from our experience and our unique approach to provide a unique response. It's exactly the type of skill sets needed to survive and thrive in this future of work.

Rahat Chowdhury  23:33  
Yeah, I really love that you bring that up. Sometimes people ask me, like, getting into technology or becoming a developer, like what should they do? And one thing I tell them that I've heard other people say too, is like, find a problem that you have and just try to solve it doesn't have to be a huge problem. Just something small, whatever, something that you want to fix, and try to fix it. I think that doesn't just apply to technology. Like you just brought that up like you apply that same problem solving technique to something else doesn't just have to be in technology. It can be in tech, law, politics, whatever you want to do. So I really, really like that you mentioned that 

Daniel Adeyanju  24:11  
Agreed. And I think it's, frankly, a skill set. And I realized it's more working with students and trying to teach it to them. Like I'm thinking like, you know, these are, these are young folks. Like, they're probably already thinking this way. And I think this is one of the conceits of being in tech. I'm at a point we start to surround ourselves with folks like, like us. And as much as I think, as much as I enjoy that, I want to make sure that these skills are not seen as just for us, like I've even heard folks. So some folks will, will some I've heard some, like programmers, kind of like talk down boot camps, um, for the simple reason that they want to have competition at work. And then it's gonna bring the price down. I mean you've heard that narrative, right? I'm gonna beat all these developers. I think that Hilarious just be a better developer, bro. Just be a better developer. Like, let's get more people in. Like, why are we afraid of having more people get smarter not to say that you're not smart before meeting tech, but like, they are strong problem solving skills that are emphasized in programming. So I'm looking for people developing that skill of problem solving. So the point is make is that when I noticed, I had my students to a problem journal, which is a really great activity, right? So, um, it's very easily set to just solve a problem around you. That's actually really hard for most people, because we've actually been taught that the way the world is how it's going to be, which is the biggest lie ever. Um, and but it's a great it's a great lie to keep us like, you got to find something real quick to hold on to and just like latch on to that and just like, just live life on autopilot when the people that are really making the money and moving the terms of society. There, they have to think outside the box. That's how we have the innovators, right? So we can foster innovative thinking. And it's a process innovation is sometimes bought, like, just like light bulb disappears over your head. And then you're like, a crazy inventor or something like that. But it's, it's a process that's that can be taught it can be developed. So I would suggest that folks actually intentionally sit down and write and journal and think about what are the things that I was frustrated about today? And how could those things be better? Like it might be on a site that you already use, and you might create a version of that site that works better? It might be something like within a large macro problem space, such as, um, you could be talking about hunger, right? And then you come up with some what are some different problems in terms of hunger, you talking to people like before you get to the building, like talk to people like I see it's way too often. We're in some and we're all guilty of this. I need to get a project for my portfolio. All right, what am I gonna build? Right? You just start building something hacking something together. It's usually like a version of something that already exists already, which isn't a bad thing. But like imagine like the story, you can tell it in the interview that was like, I was really frustrated about finding some sort of products that I need for my hair. And I realized it was hard to get reviews from my friends, I had to call my different friends. Like, I wonder what if there was a review site? Right? Even the review site concept is not new. Um, it's not anything unique. And you could totally find a tutorial, I just write it up, but the story is way better. And that story is what's going to resonate on the other side. More than Yeah, I made a simple crud app, get some reviews, throw it on AWS like, the story is everything 

Rahat Chowdhury  27:53  
I like that. Like bringing, like other people's kind of stories into things. Yeah. Like when I was first like, I guess, coding or doing random projects, I would just like, look at my problem trying to solve it. And the whole thing about like talking to other people and trying to get their perspectives on, it wasn't something I did until more recently. And I think that really, really takes like a simple project into something that is really good. And the same, probably, it definitely can be applied to companies just like you can reach out to people figure out what they need, what problem they're having, or even better hire them to help solve the problem because they're going through the thing.

Daniel Adeyanju  28:35  
It goes back to tech is for the humans, right? tech tech for humans. So you got to talk to humans get to know what their problems are, what are their pain points, what makes them a little frustrated, and it's gonna be hard for them to even realize it. That's why the serve the value you're adding is by helping them focus on that. That's the power of design thinking. And whenever I look at these frameworks, I'm like, this is so simple, like why doesn't everyone do it? But And again, this kind of goes back to like, Tech has learned all these things, but society hasn't really caught up on it because it's just so different but like yeah, like talk to humans just let's go back to like 20 years ago like before Mac was popular PCs for developer were gospel that was what you're supposed to use. If you' weren't using PC, you must be dumb. Like, do you I don't know if you remember that time, like it was literally like, PCs are for smart people. Macs are for people who aren't smart enough to use PCs.

Hasibul Chowdhury  29:30  
Yeah, I remember those ads.

Daniel Adeyanju  29:32  
It was and you know, it's funny I forgot it was the ad so that was part of the arm the site guys at the time, but it also was a trickle down from these developers who are thinking definitely in that way. Um, because the Mac was, was designed to be easy to use. Fast forward to now, all developers are using Mac so apple and this has been this dead this horse has been beating on dead, Ultimately, um, this idea of Steve Jobs is like somebody who really understand that like this is about humans. I'm like no I don't know much about his his relationships with humans and and and like talking to them so this might not be this always the best idea but he brought in the human aspect me to like give him a story around font fonts like an art and and how people might want their words to look a bit more pretty than just like a typewriter. Like that's simple concept. The GU being a little bit easier to use the Apple products where the iPhone being so easy to babysit, like literally right now. babies learn how to use an iPad

Hasibul Chowdhury  30:50  
Yeah, my kid definitely can attest to that. Like if I leave my phone around my kid is already in watching videos without like me doing anything. 

Daniel Adeyanju  30:58  
Yeah, yeah, it's it's Human Centered Design and if everybody everyone has that skill, I think we will fundamentally, live in a better world, people can design a better existence for themselves for their families, but people around them when they build companies and institutions, they can think about more people as they're doing it. Um, like his PC, I think, a lot of technology back in the day, he was like, Look, I made this technology for you. You're welcome right now it's switched to like, hey, like, I really want you to use my, my, my technology. Look, it's so easy to use, like, I have to take care of everything for you just hop on, like you didn't have to pay. Forget about money, you don't even need just try it. Just try it will pay you to use it. In a sense, right. So the paradigm has completely shifted and advantages people who are thinking about the humans that they're building for. So anyone who's listening, I really hope that they take your title So literally, and they make listening to this podcast and engaging with your content a part of their thought process and not just, um, you know, just take it at face value like this is real, like if you are really thinking about humans as you're building, because you also want to think as a developer, you're going to be thinking about the user experience of your team, like, how are you? How is your team interfacing with you? I've heard of people writing user manuals for themselves, that is user centered design. I'm product, my my developers on my team, I need if I can optimize the experience for them. They're gonna love me and you know, at this company, we're going to do great things together. When we inevitably move to other companies, they're going to be looking for me, I think the user experience design or user centric. mindset is valuable to anyone. And I think it's also I wanted to also I did mention this before, I also have a podcast and its very much about the future of work. So that's that's kind of like another term that kind of encapsulates a lot of my work. I'm thinking about this future of work this, we're seeing our big glimpse of it now. A big peek into the future right now, it's a little bit forced. So it's like literally like a lab experiment. It's almost like somebody who's like, Alright, let's make sure that people can kind of test the waters a little bit before we go, like, full future work. But all this is real, like, we're being on zoom. I'm still waiting on a on VR, like VR is a really good time for VR to take off. But, um, you know, maybe in the next stimulus check, they'll just send us a VR VR headset, but all the technology is moving so quickly. How do we make sure that we're prepared and all prepare people of all backgrounds right, so I think I happen to believe that tech people are the most prepared for this future of work. We've been living in it. It's so like, the novelty is our norm like There's a new framework out, boom, all right, you can you can apply those same ways of thinking to just anything else having to work and a lot of the shift is going to be technological. But how do we make sure that folks that don't consider themselves to be tech people see themselves as people who are savvy enough to use the tools and technology to be able to be effective and to be great in the future of work? 

Hasibul Chowdhury  34:24  
One thing I wanted to connect, you mentioned all the time about inclusion, especially with tech, you know, especially with New York City, everyone, all the students having to work from home. And not everyone has the luxury have having devices at home. There's so many tweets or Facebook messages, about four or five siblings sharing one device, right? So here's something that tech can easily fix, right? People are like, Oh, no, school is your go in person. It's always in person, but now they're showing. No you can set up classrooms, to be from remote anywhere, using any device and But without having people that have lived through it or experienced it, or understand the different backgrounds or home lives, there's no way tech companies can provide for that. Like, Rahat? You worked at Newsela, right? How many messages Did you get about students and teachers not being able to afford your platform? Right? I remember you told me all that stuff. But now that what? boot camps making easier for people with different backgrounds, joining tech and getting into tech, I feel like there's gonna be a resurgence like a new new renaissance of technology making life easier for humans in general. And, you know, it's taken a while, but I feel like we're finally getting there. So like you mentioned a while back about developer bros, looking down on Bootcamp, grads. I'm like, Yeah, I get it. They didn't do it four years of CS didn't learn data algorithms and system design just like you, but they have a background that you'll never be able to pick up. Right. You try to fix something. Let's say if you go in and you try to create an app for the healthcare space or even feeding the homeless. Most tech bros don't have any backgrounds with that, right, you're gonna need you're gonna need developers that have dealt with homelessness or dealt with missing meals to understand the problems and trying to fix it.

Daniel Adeyanju  36:19  
Well, that's a great point, I think the way I would encapsulate that is that we're shifting from this like, over specialist state, in in knowledge work, to having folks that are part of the larger team and can inject because innovation is all about having as many heads in the room as possible, that are connecting and connecting ideas. So if everyone all went to Stanford and studied computer science, and that's all they were doing for four years, what kind of product are they going to build? You need people in the room right that have walked different, different paths in life and I think boot camps allow For getting people from different backgrounds because a lot of folks are switching careers, and whatever career they had before is going to inevitably inform inform their work and bring more value to the company because they're coming from a different perspective. So excellent point there about the diversity that boot camps that's what I love about boot camps are definitely like when I was going through this pipeline, did a second bachelor's computer science I just watched the comedy black and Latino people were getting degrees, not getting jobs. So I'm like, Okay, this ain't it. I'm go to the boot camps. I see an opportunity for people to people of color get jobs still not always getting the jobs or a lot less than always right. Like the rate. That's something I talked about as well. Even when folks go and do the work. folks of color do the work. They still may not they still another shadow curriculum that's being mixed. They don't fit into the normal scripts of tech Bros. There's different kinds of tech Bros. Right? Like, there, there might be some of the cities that are favored in the industry, because that's what's been seen before, right? So right now, like every company, or every CEO is an Indian guy. If you're Indian Dude, this is a great time to get into, into tech, like, all you got to do is really know your stuff, right? Um, now I've worked with black and Latino folks that also have to get over the, the barrier of how they speak. That's a crazy barrier to get over. Right? An Indian man may have an Indian accent, but I'm hearing that in an accent like this guy by default, I'm like, Yo, this guy probably knows how to code. I mean, he could probably get down, and I mean, and you're both Bangladeshi. Right. Yeah. So I don't know if I don't know if you get that. But like, you know. So like, you know, when I talk to one of my my Latino mentees his accent is more akin to, like, when somebody's telling his accent, they're not thinking that about him. They're just like, I don't know what this guy's saying. Um, and and, you know, or you know, there's a communication barrier. And sometimes it's not just language, it's culture. It's like, I remember one of my mentees, like, he started the conversation like, Hey, I really, like you felt really comfortable with the interviewer. So he said, Hey, great to meet you, bro. And I'm like,

Rahat Chowdhury  39:27  
depending on who you're talking to...

Daniel Adeyanju  39:29  
Yea depending on who you're talking to the context switching, but he's like, rarely left the Bronx. So there's all these issues around that, you know, it's hard to blame folks on the other side, but the goal is how can everyone just think about how we can be more inclusive. If we all have the goal, and we realize innovation is gonna happen, the more types of people we have. Things are going to be more accessible for us, as well. If other people have opportunities sometimes you can think of as a zero sum game. If this guy gets an opportunity. If this black guy is gets an opportunity on, then. And I don't. That's not, that's I don't want to go. I don't want to make a backup from that. Like if this guy gets an opportunity of any background, and yes, the reason why I said the black guy, because that's a real conversation, right? There's like, folks that think that, um, you know, there's this talk about reverse racism that yeah, if they hire that guy, like he must not be good enough. It must be affirmative action. And he's taking away my spot. That's the same conversation that happens in the college circles, right? Like, oh, there's all these spots, all the black people are taking that let's look at the goal. Look at the numbers again, and it's definitely not the case, right? Um, but I am I am all about increasing pathways and technology. I think there's so many ways to learn online now. And there's, there's a need for problem solvers, that is criminal, for not it's criminal to not create pathways for anyone who wants to do good work. 

Rahat Chowdhury  40:59  
I love all the stuff that you've been mentioning, another thing that I wanted to kind of talk about too probably Yeah, definitely relate to the things you've been saying you started something I think called life after Bing you are you're kind of helping black and Latino folks. I guess kind of find those pathways after college. 

Daniel Adeyanju  41:18  
Yeah, absolutely. So, thanks for asking about that. That's, um, work that stemmed out of going to this Upstate, Ivy of the SUNY's I say that anywhere I go to so I can get some more value from that degree that I  pay for you know, self proclaimed, I'm grade school in SUNY system, State University of New York, upstate New York. And somehow I graduated without knowing anything about this evolving world technology. Just being a natural technologist. I'm like, how come I don't know about this, like, I'm already doing the same type of problem solving, organizing people building. I used to do a lot events bring people together. Um, so I kind of felt like why did no one Tell me about this, this field? So, and I'm the type of person and once I start getting something I, once I start learning about something new, I'm making sure everybody my tribe knows about it. So I was actively just like, like as I was learning about it, so Hey, did you get into tech? Like, I even like start my CS degree? I'm like telling people like, hey, let's get into tech. No one's listening to me. It's like, yeah, Nah, man I'm not into tech like, no, it's not for me, right? You know, I'm not really a techie type of person. I'm not good at math. So I'm already seeing like, Whoa, there's like a huge disconnect here. I used to be the person who changed it, right? So I'm like, this is a problem that I need to solve. We need more black and Latino folks in tech. So I took it upon myself to get in the field, as I'd mentioned before, um, knowing also that I wouldn't ultimately stay as a programmer for long I knew that ultimately. And I started to learn as I was a startup, I learned about product management, and that's the space that I plan to say, oh, what do you do in a Role that's in a job description, I would say Product Manager. But bring me light after bing evolved out of the place that I went to school with that problem. And you know, there's problems everywhere in the country, how do I go back to where I'm from? And I thought about doing it Bronx science, and I did, you know, connect a lot of folks, Bronx science. Um, but the problem was really more in terms of at the collegiate level or the bigger problem. My network was wider in terms of, as we know, like our high school didn't have a lot of black Latino folks. And that's like, also really early in the pipeline. So I'd have to wait a while to see a result. So it's like, how about Bing How about how do I pick off folks that are about to graduate, and don't really know what they want to do, and get them into tech. So and also give some background about how big this problem is? Binghamton university, I mean, so few students of color, were graduating with computer science degrees, so I was like, wait a minute. So this is the future is being built and based on the small sample size of my college, very few of them are black or Latino, almost none really, like I could count on my fingers and very few like stay in the industry. So it's like, Alright, cool. So the computer science department is not going to do it. Clearly. I have the agency to connect with folks and sell them on this tech dream. So I launched on that journey. And I quickly realized it's not all about tech, it's really about the skills, the skill set. So if you want to be a doctor, how about you be a doctor? That's like, an innovation minded doctor, which would be really helpful in time to COVID on an innovation would include is not limited to understand how to use technology. So I pivoted and said, How do we create this black and Latino alumni organization that supporting current students and exposing them to all kinds of careers so starting it in Um, I think I say like technically 2017 with a couple of friends and then expanding it so some students that were mentoring that went to various fields became part of my team. So we've been able to have two summits to bring students together connecting with alumni. So that's an experience that I started to work with my partners really awesome individuals who were mostly students when I first started and now have awesome careers to reimagine what can the career pathway look like? If you are constantly aware of what's on the other side while you're in school so life after bing was really is and was really about having students think about what problems they want to solve actually believe that all throughout education, like from pre K to college grad, they should always be asking you in question boot camps as well. What problem do you want to solve? If everyone was asked that question? I think we'd be in a way better world. 

Rahat Chowdhury  45:57  
Yeah, definitely. I don't think I've ever been asked that question throughout school, college, whatever, even in boot camp, when I went, it's usually, like, the first time I've ever even like heard of like, trying to solve a problem that you have is like, just from people like giving advice on like how to break into tech or whatever. And it's interesting that it's never asked at all throughout our entire, like, we went through what, like 12 years of education and four years of college and never came up.It's like a lot of things that need to just fundamentally change. 

Daniel Adeyanju  46:37  
Oh, absolutely. It's like we're taught to kind of accept the status quo. It's easier to, to for society to be trying to find a synonym for control because that sounds conspiratorial, like conspiracy theory, but yeah, and it says, I mean, government is about control, right? It's not happening, right? Like we don't want people wildin just running around doing crazy stuff. But at the same time, I think there's value to having more people thinking in an innovative way I think I mean a lot of government and all these things are about one size fit all policies and i think it's it's really interesting, right because I can veer to the side of like kind of a conservative view where conservatives like lead for libertarian more likely, which is why they're so over represented in tech, actually Peter teal in them, like, Hey, he's let people kind of do their own thing and just navigate the world on their own. But like government provides frameworks and like, for example, like school ever in there's like, these frameworks around how school operates, and everyone is kind of doing the same things, right. there's value in that. But now, what's possible if students can create their own tracks, and I think, unlike before, that's not it was not scalable with teachers, right, but now hybrid model fundamentally lends to that individualized learning. Um, how can teachers really individualize how they engage is to how can you grow a student's interest in whatever if someone's really into cars, right? Yo, throw them in don't have a book about engines, you'll figure that out. You're not interested in the engines like what do you you know, what else you're interested in? Are you just in painting them or, or, you know, you might go that track, it might even connect other things that maybe you learn the chemistry of how the paint works, and that gets you interested in chemistry. Now, technology because that goes with humans. I mean, before something now you need a tutor, an individual tutor, and some people have that. So people have I think we, we need to look at what the what's on the top line of educate like the top of the line education looks like what a rich folks getting, and how can we use technology to get that to more people that don't have that kind of money. And it's not gonna be the same per se, but it would avail people more of the opportunities to get really quality instruction and to really follow their passion. 

Rahat Chowdhury  49:15  
Awesome. Yeah. All awesome points that you've been bringing up. Yeah, throughout this whole episode. So yeah, we usually like to wrap up our episodes with kind of like a catch up session. So what are you up to kind of outside of, you know, this work you've been doing? 

Daniel Adeyanju  49:32  
Yeah, man. Mmm hmm. Outside of the work I'm doing it's that's, I think everything connects right, especially in time of COVID. Everything kind of connects. I mean, this didn't really change much for me, to be honest with me. It just kind of like, just made it more real like Oh, snap, like, future work is really coming. I've been onto something. Now the only one is onto it. But um, I've been I've been thinking a lot about how do you help people accomplish their goals, I think especially with what's going on now everyone's at home is a lot of change. How do people help people accomplish their goals? weather change? How do you design things to do that? So I've been running with a few of my friends, we actually did a conference together called stay by stay home, play on South by Southwest, getting folks together, talking about the future of work and other topics. So that with that same team, we're working on getting daily stand ups off the ground, for anybody. So I think the motto is going to be set daily standards for the rest of us, right. So it's big in tech. But I think it's really valuable for anyone, especially what I would call a business creative, to have a structured time where they can communicate with other people and say, This is what I'm working on this one when accomplished. We were working on that piling that starting from humans, and then we can think about technology and this is something that's valuable. We can do it. You know, I'm sure you've Like the Mechanical Turk way of doing things when you're starting a business like you know, it's a black box solution, you may not know that they're fulfilling it like the manual way, but you're just happy to like get your deliveries happy to get whatever solution that you asked for. So where Mechanical Turk can get something super small, but I'm excited about that project. I've just been connecting with folks. You know, recording stuff, my podcasts that be great podcasts really hope folks, check us out as well on I'm not going to say not all the podcast platform, mainly Spotify, and Apple, but it's been it's, I think, now I'm thinking of it. So my motto is always be always be connecting, always be building and always be learning. That's the order of operations. So connecting first because anything of value is gonna come through people, information, opportunities, all that always be building because that's how that's truly how you develop skills and increase your value and you create and solve problems in the world. And always be learning. So all those things are highly connected. And that's what I spend my days doing, even if I'm coding.
