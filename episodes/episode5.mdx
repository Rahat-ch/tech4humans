Rahat Chowdhury  0:15  
Hi, I'm Rahat.

Hasibul Chowdhury  0:17  
Hi I am Hasibul and you're listening to tech4humans.

Rahat Chowdhury  0:21  
Welcome to a brand new episode of tech4humans. On today's episode, our guest is Joan. Joan, can you take a second to introduce yourself for everyone?

Joan Westenberg  0:30  
Hello, I am Joan Westenberg, writer, creative PR tech executive and occasional tech journalist as well. Oh, in the context of this episode, I am a very out and proud super loud trans women.

Rahat Chowdhury  0:44  
That is awesome. And yeah, part of the reason why we brought you here we brought you in because we wanted to talk a little bit about something you've done recently and that's your work with transgender inclusion.com. Can you tell us a little bit about What that is what the inspiration behind it was?

Joan Westenberg  1:03  
definitely. So I mean, it should come as no surprise that being transgender is an obstacle for many folks careers, you know, like, even in tech, which is relatively progressive, there is still a dichotomy, like there is still a whole separation between people who are trans and people who are other forms of queer in terms of employment, you'll be having a higher rate of unemployment. And when you add to that, that rate of unemployment you also have statistics around how even when we do find jobs, we experienced higher rates of harassment, higher rates of workplaces descrimination than other folks do as well. And we tend to last for shorter periods in jobs once we get them because of that discrimination. And it just makes the workplace really difficult for us. So when I transitioned, one of the things that I really wanted to do was to use the platform that I have and the um, the profile that I have to promote inclusion to promote the idea of being more accepting To trans people, and I also want to create a tool that would allow people to do just that. I think one of the biggest issues is not necessarily the folks innately transphobic in tech, like not at all, I think people really want to help and support us. I think the issue is that they don't know how, and they don't have the toolset in place. So by creating an open source policy that people could copy and work on themselves and bring into their companies, my goal was to make it easier for us to include trans people absolutely everywhere.

Rahat Chowdhury  2:31  
Cool. Yeah. I definitely got that from reading through the document a little bit beforehand. One of the things that you mentioned was, you did like a lot of research and things that like went into creating it. Can you tell us a little bit about, you know, what that research was, and you know, what parts of it were really helpful or anything like that?

Joan Westenberg  2:51  
Yeah, so I mean, obviously, I started from my own personal experience of being trans in tech and what that meant and the requirements that I had, you know, when I when I transitioned And the company that I was working for a tech company here in Sydney, they asked what they could do to support me. And so I went straight to my list of, of dream things they could do, you know, they could allow me to use the bathroom of my choice, they could encourage and require people to use my new name instead of my old name, that kind of stuff. So that was the starting point of the policy. But after that, I was going everywhere. You know, one of my friends Aubrey, at the time she was head of people in culture at Atlassian. And she provided me with a whole bunch of their documentation that they have, which touched on some of these issues so that I could use that. And Aubrey really helped to kind of shape some stuff. They're using the stuff that she was doing at Atlassian. And beyond that, I was going to universities who had policies, I was going to other companies who have policies, I was looking everywhere I could for people who had set in stone some of the protections that trans people need to be okay in the workplace.

Hasibul Chowdhury  3:51  
That's amazing of how far you went to get this information. You know, is how did you get feedback For your policy, and how did you incorporate feedback while writing this policy,

Joan Westenberg  4:04  
so I passed it around to other trans people that I know who worked in tech, and other HR people don't know as well. So you know why I'm one of the people that I've worked with a lot through my digital agency. Now, her name is Hilary Callaghan. She runs a company called h rebel. And she put a lot of time and effort into going through the documents with me and making sure they matched my HR requirements for working in Australia to make sure that it was going to be acceptable for the people there. But in addition to that, people like Aubrey, look through it and give me feedback as well of a trans and non binary people gave me feedback and so on. So when in an earlier edition of the policy, it did have a section talking about intersex people in the same framing as trans people. And some feedback that I got from the intersex community was we don't see ourselves as trans. This policy is not really about us and you're talking about us in the wrong way. Like you've got everything wrong. And that was great feedback, to get Because I didn't know how wrong I was. So I could go back, take those parts out of the policy, send it back to them and help them to like, get to a point where they were happy with it, too. So it was, you know, accepting that I don't get everything right. And one of the reasons why this isn't open source policy is because I don't get everything right all the time. I get. I'm pretty smart. So I get 99% of stuff, right?

Rahat Chowdhury  5:24  
So is that kind of why I guess you made it an open source versus like making it kind of like a consulting thing for companies?

Joan Westenberg  5:31  
Well, I guess there's two points on that. One of them is, I'm big into open source and copyright free stuff. So everything that I make is it's public domain, essentially. So like, if I write a book and I put it out there, I wrote a book. Over the past few weeks it was released. It's called hashtag DIY, fuck the gatekeepers. And it's a book about doing your own thing your own way. And that book is public domain. Anyone can take whatever they want from a copy and paste to reprint or do whatever the hell they want. Because that's my DIY you Like, no copyright ethos, so that's part of it. But another part is, I didn't want to go out and start consulting for companies to, like, make money from this thing, because the goal was not, let's find me a new revenue stream, the goal was, let's find a way to help other folks like me who might not have the levels of privilege that I have, you know, I mean, I'm a very privileged person I have a career in in tech. And yes, that career has taken a huge hit since I transitioned, but I still have a great network and a great profile. And, and yes, I'm a trans woman, but I'm still a white trans woman I have that privilege too and the thinking was, okay, well, let's use that to help other people. Let's not profit from it.

Rahat Chowdhury  6:38  
That's Yeah, definitely awesome. And definitely fits in with basically the premise of our whole podcast meaning tech for humans. So I also wanted to ask, when I was reading through your document, you mentioned that oftentimes, you're, I guess, the first trans woman that a lot of people meet. How's that experience been kind of like, you know, working in tech and being that first person that people often meet? And, you know, have you kind of have you kind of dealt with that?

Joan Westenberg  7:12  
Yeah, it's been interesting. Hey, um, you get some, some pretty invasive questions from time to time. You know? Like, I've met people at startup networking drinks, who have asked me if I've had surgery on my genitals, or who asked me if I sit down while I pee like really invasive personal questions, they would never ask anyone else. And that's, it's kind of confronting to be us that kind of stuff, you know, over drinks at like a, like a pitch night. It's, it's confronting, it's really uncomfortable. But in general, I have taken the approach of trying to answer every question in good faith. And it's not easy to answer in good faith because you do feel a bit violated by this stuff, but to give people a clear on so explain why the question wasn't appropriate, but make space To educate, because as long as I can educate people, then the next time they meet a trans person, they'll they'll, they'll know how to act know how to talk to us. And the I guess the 101 is he talked to us like he would talk to absolutely every single other person. Like you ask us the same questions. You don't ask us the same questions. It's that simple. And so I kinda want to model that behavior, but also give people the space to learn that behavior.

Rahat Chowdhury  8:24  
Yeah, I'm kind of just trying to think of that, like, my own terms. Like, I've never been asked that. I'm trying to understand, like, why someone would like, ask a personal question like that.

Joan Westenberg  8:37  
I think we, like trans people are unusual, like we're not something that you come across every day and so people are curious, but that curiosity is like the context for the Curiosity is kind of lurid media depictions of what trans people are, you know, but if you are a person who doesn't know any, any other trans people, then what do you have to go on? Okay, you have, you have Caitlyn Jenner, who is Not a great role model or a great spokesperson for the trans community because you know, she has literally killed someone gotten away with it in a in an auto accident. You have media or movies that portray trans people as being deceptive or predatory or fetishistic or overly sexualized. And so people have this idea that that's who we are. And they think that we're either kind of attention seekers like Caitlyn Jenner, or we are deceptive people who just like want to be men who put on a dress or some kind of nonsense like that, instead of just saying, Okay, well, these are, these are men and women and non binary people who might exist outside of my perception of gender, but they're just normal people like everyone else. And that's kind of what we want to be accepted as, ideally, like, the dream of a trans person is not to have to be a spokesperson for every other trans person, like, we just want to be completely normal humans that like, get to exist on the same plane as everyone else and have the same conversations as everyone else, and never have to publicly talk about our genitals ever again. Doesn't seem like much to ask right?

Hasibul Chowdhury  10:01  
Yeah, I guess to like, shift the focus a little bit. You know, have you ever thought of expanding this policy globally? I know you mentioned specifically that you work to make it work in Australia, but have you thought about, you know, maybe Europe or the Americas or anything like that?

Joan Westenberg  10:23  
Yeah, sure. So, um, the latest version of the policy, I actually did work with the team at Product Hunt, to remove some of the more specifically Australian stuff to make it more more broadly accessible to people everywhere. Now, because it's an open source policy. The idea is, wherever you are in the world, you'll take this and then modify it to meet, I guess, the laws and standards of where you are. And you have the freedom to do that, you know, because I can't speak to the rules and regulations of some places in the US, you know, I mean, I think it was Ohio, was it. somewhere like that, over the weekend use the Coronavirus crisis. To push through more anti trans legislation than they've ever had, and like, so any policy that exists in that state needs to take that kind of thing into consideration. So I can't write that. But I can provide the building blocks of it, which is this open source policy. And yes, thanks to the folks who product and I have made it more broadly accessible, so it can be a better foundation stone for folks. But yeah, this is the starting point, if you want to do that.

Rahat Chowdhury  11:24  
Gotcha, you mentioned before, like some feedback you've gotten. Are there any specific companies that you kind of got it? You mentioned Product Hunt, there are and do you know of like any companies who are trying to like adopt this into their culture?

Joan Westenberg  11:37  
Oh, yeah. Look, I have hundreds on my list. A lot of them are Australian. Some of them are us. Some of them are venture capital funds. Some of them are consulting firms, some of the tech startups. The company that I worked with , Flair, they have adopted this policy. There's a venture capital fund here who are backbone Australia's biggest banks who are working to adopt the policy like it's just, it's awesome. Like people are really backing up

Rahat Chowdhury  12:00  
Yeah, that's really cool. Like I was reading through it, I was thinking back like at some of the jobs I've had, I've worked in a few different startups in tech. And really out of every company I've been at, I've only seen one that actually kind of like follows a lot of the guidelines that you've listed out. In the job I had before this one, it was like at an Ed tech company. And I remember, you know, going into the men's room, and you know, there were tampons, and like, everyone was just allowed, like, go to where you're more comfortable. That was the first time like I've ever seen it. And yeah, that's, that was great. And it was like one of the first times I personally had like an interaction with a transgender person. I, one of my team members. Basically, it was like In the midst of transitioning, and they had come to me and told me that, you know, they were making that transition. And it was, I was trying to figure out like the best way to, I guess just kind of be there for them. I wish I had something like this to go off of. But yeah, I was just thinking to myself, like, you know, if someone would come to you with any problem, what would you do? Just like listen.

Joan Westenberg  13:26  
And the, I guess the, the really basic advice I give is if you met a trans person and you want to know how to support them, treat them like every other person, you know, but let them know that you do support them but let them know, you have their back. You know, I I was out for drinks with a bunch of folks from the sales team, my last company and someone came up to harass me in the pub and they just closed ranks around me to instantly protect me because they were on the watch for that kind of harassment. So If you are friends with a trans person, step up, have their back. But do it in a real tangible way.

Hasibul Chowdhury  14:07  
Are there any resources you would say that people can go to like, figure out how to be helpful? You know, you have your policies here for companies to adopt, but how about personal stuff that people can look up and figure out a way how to communicate and show that they want to be there?

Joan Westenberg  14:22  
Yeah. So in Australia, there's some great resources from acon and from the gender center. So if you're in Australia, you can look them up. Actually, if you're anywhere in the world, you can look those up. But there will be specific resources for the USA as well. I'm not sure what those would be. Exactly. But there's definitely some stuff out there too. Yeah, so I can't speak to the US. But yeah, in Australia, or if you're in the US, and you want to see what we have here. You can go to acon or you can look up the gendercenter.au and there's some really good resources there.

Rahat Chowdhury  14:52  
Awesome. So I guess going back to, I guess, the project itself, as you mentioned, it's open source. How can like other Folks contribute to the document,

Joan Westenberg  15:03  
essentially, and I'm working out the best way forward from that. So it started out as a Google Doc share with a bunch of different trans people that we could edit. And people could just have a request to edit the document. And I would approve that, but we're moving into GitHub soon. So it should be on GitHub in the next month or so. And then people can just do it the usual way, the pull requests.

Hasibul Chowdhury  15:21  
Do you see any issues coming up by switching this over from you being the point of truth, like with the Google Docs, just switching over to GitHub? 

Joan Westenberg  15:32  
I'll find out when I get there.

Rahat Chowdhury  15:35  
Will you be kind of like the core maintainer for like approvals? 

Joan Westenberg  15:38  
Yeah, definitely. Yeah. 

Rahat Chowdhury  15:40  
So how can others kind of like support this project in general, other than contributing?

Joan Westenberg  15:46  
You can promote it, like spread the word tweet about it, shout about it. You can invite me to be on your podcast and talk about it. You can. You can share it around. The most basic thing you can probably do is you can print out the policy and you can take to whoever's running people and culture, your company, and you can say that it would matter to you and will mean a lot to you personally if they would adopt it.

Hasibul Chowdhury  16:07  
What advice do you have for other transgender or non binary people that are trying to break into tech, you mentioned how you had this great tech job. And then once you transition, it kind of took a hit. You know, what are some things you did to help mitigate that? And what are what are some advice you have for others?

Joan Westenberg  16:24  
Yeah, look, I haven't exactly mitigated that yet. So I have I have launched my own projects, because I've struggled to get through the barriers of tech ever since I transitioned. So for some background, I have a I have a 10 year career in comms and messaging and media and brand and marketing in tech. I've won awards for it. So I have a platinum Hermes award for digital PR. And I've worked in companies that have been valued to hundreds of millions of dollars. But since I transitioned, I can't get a single interview. So it's been eight months since I was had a job interview because people just look at my profile, and they reject me immediately with a automated email. So that's kind of a shitty thing. You know, before transitioning, I was in demand, like people were actively headhunting me. And these days, I can't even get a face to face meeting. So I have decided to build my own thing and do my own thing and act on my own terms. And my advice for anyone else getting into tech is one, if you can do that, do that. Like if you can be the gatekeeper, be the gatekeeper. Two if you can't, you're going to have to be real patient, because it takes ages to break into it. If you are trans, and three, your network matters. So like us, your network, you aren't getting called. And I guess my advice for anyone working in tech right now is ask yourself, do you work with any trans or non binary people right now? And if the answer is no, I can promise you it's not because they haven't applied. It's because your company hasn't hired them. So ask yourself what your company could be doing better.

Rahat Chowdhury  18:02  
Yeah, I guess what do you think? What are some ways like people who are in tech can like kind of bring that to the attention of their companies a little bit more.

Joan Westenberg  18:15  
They can try to fight for insist on blind hiring processes where the gender and identity in the name of the candidate is not revealed in that selection process. They can insist on having the stats and the data around the hiring, you know, like, Who are we hiring? Why are we hiring in those demographics?

Hasibul Chowdhury  18:38  
You know, I'm actually trying to remember like, I just finished my job search last week. And you're right, like the amount of applications that I've sent out to replies. I'm just wondering how the systems are biased already. Because some of them I got automatic replies, the second I sent In email, and others, it like waits for a couple of days if someone actually goes through it. And yeah, I know people who write all these blog posts about hacking the automated resume systems. And you're right, I don't I don't know why I had a few even when I've signed up, like, it asks me to enter my gender. You know, there's no reason why my skills or anyone's skills, you know, requires their gender be revealed for the application. 

Joan Westenberg  19:30  
Absolutely no reason at all. Yeah. And but we see this like all the time in like so many different areas. So like, we know that like the database is out, we know that there is discrimination, when the name of a candidate is revealed when a gender is revealed, and so on. And it's not just based on gender. It's also based on race like that discrimination is absolutely happening just based on the names of candidates. And when those when those names are like anonymized that racial discrimination or that gender discrimination goes away. Because people aren't making that judgment call based on a name or gender, I think that kind of thing needs to change. You know, we need to, we need to be looking at that kind of discrimination.

Rahat Chowdhury  20:10  
Yeah. Now that I'm kind of like thinking back to it, there's, in every single job application, pretty much I've ever done. There's always been that question, What's your gender? Do you have a disability? And I know, so like, I don't know if it's the same in Australia, but in the US, it's they put this behind, like, Oh, we have an anti discrimination policy. So we need to do this. And I always thought to myself, but like, if you have like an anti discrimination thing, then you don't need to know this.

Joan Westenberg  20:44  
Exactly. Right. Exactly. Right.

Rahat Chowdhury  20:47  
I'm like, yeah, it's, it's just like baked in as part of the application process. So that's definitely something that needs to be overhauled. Quite a bit. Yeah. To get that sort of like blind, application going.

Hasibul Chowdhury  21:06  
Yeah, I was just gonna ask you I know like Rahat, I guess two jobs ago when you were more of a manager or even last job. you're hiring like, you just see the shift how, especially in tech people are searching to those resumes with their headshots on it.

Joan Westenberg  21:22  
Yeah I did see that.

Hasibul Chowdhury  21:24  
when I was hiring for someone to work in my team and my last job, I think over 50% of the resumes I got had headshots on it. And I'm just thinking, like, when did that shift happened? When was that required? Because that already puts in bias, I'm not saying that I'm perfect. I know that like there's biases that I'm working on and just educating myself. But like that shift and I feel like this is only with tech resumes. They put your headshot on it. And like I don't know what made it standardized and I think that's also hurting because now people have this understanding like Hey, where's the head shot? Like, I feel like hiring managers already looking for that specific type of resume.

Joan Westenberg  22:07  
I think it started getting standardized like people started doing their CV's like that once Canva got popular and like people were just using the same resume templates and their resume templates had a space for a profile pic. And because honestly, as a hirer, I can't tell you the last time I got a CV that didn't look like a Canva template.

Rahat Chowdhury  22:27  
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I can see like with templates, like everyone's using the same template. Yeah, same information is kind of there.

Joan Westenberg  22:35  
Yeah. So I don't think I don't think it's been a requirement that anyone's had that all you have to have a profile pic on your CV. I think it's just the people were using the same template and had that incidental became standardized. And so now it's expected.

Rahat Chowdhury  22:50  
I know I remember someone. On Twitter, I posted this like, there are some countries that do require it like in Germany. I think it's required so it seems like there are some companies that are or countries that are requiring that and that just kind of like opens Oh, yeah. You know, full on, like, if I don't like the way you look or you don't conform to like how my company is supposed to be imaged then, you know?

Joan Westenberg  23:22  
That's it. And I mean, at the end of the day, I am a tattooed, punk rock trans woman, like, I don't fit many molds. So if you're, if you're judging me based on how I look like you're probably gonna skip me over to someone else. But it shouldn't come down to that. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  23:38  
It definitely shouldn't. But unfortunately, that's where it's going. And I feel like you mentioned tattoos like now I feel like the tech bros term we use now, every single tech bro was getting these tattoos and it's like, oh, you're making something cool or fashionable and you're still able to get a job.

Rahat Chowdhury  24:00  
It's definitely much easier tech bro.

Joan Westenberg  24:03  
Yeah, look if you are if you're a white straight cisgendered tech, bro, like, you got an easier path, you know, it's just the truth of it. And that's not me being a fucking victim like I don't I don't sit around feeling sorry for myself, I work my ass off constantly I hustle and grind constantly but it's just the reality of it. You know, I am a realist and I look at the world and I say, Okay, well, that's what I've got to face. And so I'm going to get up every single day I'm going to face it and overcome every single obstacle that they put in front of me. But I'm also not going to feel sorry for people who don't have those obstacles, and one, a whinge about how hard their lives you know, like, yeah, I'm not gonna feel sorry for you if you've got an easier path than I have. And you're not taking action.

Rahat Chowdhury  24:46  
Absolutely. Yeah, we've been talking a little bit about, you know, privilege. It was like that for like another couple episodes ago as well. And like you started this podcast, I was saying like, you know, you have privilege as well being like a white transgender person. And it's just like, it's refreshing to, you know, to hear people both like, you know, acknowledge what their privilege is. Also, like, look at, you know, where we're at were disadvantaged as well, like Hasibul and I are both, you know, South Asian dudes and in tech, we're kind of, okay. Asian men tend to do pretty fine. Pretty okay. But, yeah, I definitely love that you had mentioned that as well.

Joan Westenberg  25:45  
I mean, just in terms of being trans, like, the white, white trans people have it easier because white people have it easier. You know, the, the higher rates of violence against trans women like it is. It's mostly black and indigenous trans women. who suffer the most? Like, that's where that's where the fatalities are. That's where the murders are. That's where the abuses and white trans women don't have that as much. So I'm just I'm very, I'm very cognizant of how much safer I am just based on my privilege, you know?

Rahat Chowdhury  26:15  
Awesome. So we usually like to wrap up our episodes, kind of like with a catch up session, kind of see like, what you're doing outside of, I guess, transgenderinclusion.com. And I had seen you make a couple announcements you were doing like kind of your own podcast. I think you've also had like a forum, I think was pizza party.com?

Joan Westenberg  26:37  
Yes. So outside of my outside of the transgender inclusion policy, I this year I launched my own tech focused PR agency called studio self. Very Luckily, I launched it right before a global recession. Yay go me. And so you know, like I built up a pretty awesome portfolio of clients. But the Coronavirus recession has kind of wiped out that portfolio. So I'm at the moment I'm working on rebuilding that and just getting it back to where it needs to be. So I had some staff who I've, I've paid up and now like waiting for the money to keep coming back in so we can do that. But outside of that I have a self care community that I founded called tiny spells, where it's thousands and thousands of people and they get a daily email with just three things they can do each day to look after their health, their mental health and their well being. It's kind of like, finimize but for your own self care. I have a blog called pizza party and a podcast as well which is my thoughts about culture, business, technology and creativity. And I am about to launch a, I guess a newsletter and kind of a community called less you to just about minimalism, trying to live with a little bit less than you really have to have, you know, so I do a lot of different things. Yeah.

Rahat Chowdhury  27:55  
Yeah, I think a common thing among people in tech, we have a ton of side projects at all times.

Joan Westenberg  28:04  
That's it. Yeah. And look, I guess, like everyone else. My biggest side hustle at the moment is just surviving. The Coronavirus and the economic hit that we've all taken and surviving this lock down with my mental health thing intact. So I guess the goal, right?

Hasibul Chowdhury  28:18  
Definitely, yeah. You know, you you mentioned, you sent out the the email or stuff about the three things you can do about yourself, health and well being and they'll tell what are some three advices you can have right now. Like you mentioned lockdown. I think we're in New York, everyone's locked down. I'm not sure about the situation in Australia. But what are some things people can do?

Joan Westenberg  28:39  
I'll give you the three top things that I tell everyone to do to look after themselves right now. Number one, make your bed every day. Like you get up in the morning. Don't leave that bed unmade. It lets your standards drop and it impacts your mental health in a negative way. Number two, get dressed like put on some proper clothes. Don't just spend your whole day in your PJs. Like if you spend your whole day in your pajamas. If you spend your whole day in your pajamas, It's going to depress you because you're going to feel like you're not up to your best standards, you know, dressing, good to best self. And the number one person that you should get dressed up for is you like you deserve yourself to look good for you. Doesn't matter if you leave in the house or not, they put on some clothes, put on some pants, run some shoes, like get dressed. And number three is stay hydrated. Drink water regularly, make sure you keep that up. If you don't drink water, you're not giving yourself some of the very basic building blocks of fuel that you need to survive a day. And if you get to the end of your day, and you think Fuck, I feel like shit right now. And then you look back and you haven't drank any water. Well, guess what? No one do you feel so bad.
