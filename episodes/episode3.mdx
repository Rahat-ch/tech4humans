Rahat Chowdhury  0:00  
Hi everyone this is Rahat. Before we start this episode, I wanted to let you know that the episode speaks a lot about mental illness, and touches a little bit on the experiences myself and my guests have with our mental health. We share and speak about some resources that may be helpful in dealing with some of the things we are going through. Just know that you aren't alone. As someone who suffers from major depressive disorder. I know sometimes it can feel like you aren't understood, aren't heard. And there isn't much that can be done. But there is and I hope that this is something you can take away from this episode.

Hi, I'm Rahat. 

Hasibul Chowdhury  0:43  
Hi I'm Hasibul and you're listening to tech for humans.

Rahat Chowdhury  0:47  
Welcome to Tech4humans podcast. My name is Rahat unfortunately, today Hasibul could not be with us. But we've got two awesome guests. We've got JD Flynn and Matt Trask. Can you both take a second to introduce yourselves?

J.D. Flynn  0:59  
Yeah, I'm J.D. I am a PHP Drupal developer I volunteer with OSMI. I've been doing that for about three years now I want to say, OSMI is short for open sourcing mental illness and just love being a part of it.

Matt Trask  1:18  
Yeah, my name is Matt. I'm a senior software engineer at a cool little startup in Texas called Primitive. On top of being an OSS maintainer for a couple different PHP API stuff. I've been involved with OSMI now I think about five years or so it was one of the first things I kind of got involved with. And I've done all kinds of different things for them throughout the years.

Rahat Chowdhury  1:44  
Awesome. So can you tell us a little bit more about what OSMI is what they do?

Matt Trask  1:51  
Yeah, so OSMI started I think about six years ago, and it's started with a guy named Ed Finkler, who on Twitter is @funkatron. He used to work he still kind of does he has a podcast called dev hell, which is kind of a all encompassing, they would talk about just anything tech related on that podcast, there's really no singular focus other than talking about tech and that hellscape that it is, um, and one day and went to his co host, a guy named Chris Hartjes and basically just said, Look, man, I have this thing going on, and I just need to talk about it. And so Chris was a little apprehensive at first, but he decided to let Ed do his thing and, and basically on what turned out to be about like a 45 minutes hour long podcast, Ed just laid it all out there talking about his struggles with anxiety, and depression mostly and ended up being probably the most downloaded episode of their podcast is what they've come to realize. Even now, to this day, people We'll still go find that podcast. And so after they got the podcast released people just were coming up to Ed saying, Thank you for talking about this. I thought I was all alone, I didn't realize that there was more people like me. And so he kind of put the thoughts together that there really isn't anything in tech aimed at helping people with mental health issues know that they're not alone. So he kind of started this idea of building a community around it, we introduce our now kind of like our, benevolent dictator, Joe Ferguson, who in about a two week period went from absolutely nothing to a fully incorporated 501 c 3, which, if you're listening and you know anything about filing papers for 501 c 3, like a two week turnaround is almost unheard of. He just, he had all the paperwork nailed the first time and basically went from nothing to full blown charity. And from there, they started building up kind of the ranks of the volunteers. People have come and gone as they can people kind of some people just kind of hang out in our Slack channel and kind of offer musings and anecdotes and stories, some people blog and edit blogs for us. Some of us are speakers, some people kind of work in the background to help out with the administrative stuff. But that kind of brings us from start to where we are today.

Rahat Chowdhury  4:27  
Wow, that's, that's awesome. Um, can you talk a little bit more about like, I guess what the open source part of it all means?

Matt Trask  4:34  
So a lot of us are open source developers. A lot of us deal with a language called PHP, like we are a lot of us got our start with a language called PHP. Obviously now we have a lot more developers involved. There's Ruby developers, there's Python developers, JavaScript developers, like we all play nice, but you know, all the languages are open source. That's kind of where we all come from. in that kind of aspect. A few of us are maintainers of Widely downloaded PHP packages, including like, the PHP leaks, fractal layer villas home set, vagrant box, things like that. But so we keep all of our stuff, all of our data is open source as well. And that was one of the the core points that we wanted to get through is that not only do we want to collect this data and play with it, and kind of release some studies, but we also wanted other people to have this data as well. So anytime we do a survey, we license it on a creative commons and throw it up on a data platform called Kaggle. And that allows data scientists or anyone who has kind of like a data sciences background or just likes to play with numbers and things like that. They can take our data and kind of start drawing conclusions based on that kind of stuff. So we don't hide behinda license for our data or anything. We just throw it allout there so anyone can use it. 

J.D. Flynn  5:56  
We're you know, it's not just open source technology. It's open sourcing as in, you know, starting the conversation, making it more open to everybody. And to kind of, you know, one of our core tenants is erasing the stigma. So erase the stigma around mental illness by opening it up and making people who may have mental illness not feel like they're alone.

Rahat Chowdhury  6:21  
That's awesome. So what are some of the main ways OSMI does outreach regarding mental health into the tech industry.

J.D. Flynn  6:30  
I think, you know, some of the biggest things that we do is our annual survey, which we put out yearly, which is where annual comes from, and we collect data and one of the reasons that that started is because Ed our fearless founder, um, realized that not a lot of studying has been done in in the tech industry specifically, and there's been a lot of incidences. And, you know, anecdotal evidence kind of pointing towards, hey, maybe people in the tech industry are suffering in silence. So I started doing the survey, which gave us a ton of data. And like Matt said, you know, we we put that all open on kaggle. Um, and also started with that. And then the handbooks that we have, we've got three handbooks that were based on the ADA, Americans with Disabilities Act, and those are available, also open source but we put them out on lean pub in case anybody wants to throw us a dime. And those are good for mental illness in or creating a an open workplace. There's one for HR professionals. There's one for employers. It's a collection of three. So that was vetted by I believe, a psychologist or a psychiatrist, who is also a volunteer with the organization. And we've got the speaking campaign where, like Matt said, a bunch of us go out and talk wherever we can to anybody who will listen. And we also have the forums that used to be devpress.com, which we kind of rolled up into the OSMI forums, on I think those are some of our biggest efforts, Matt, am I leaving anything out there? 

Matt Trask  8:29  
No, I mean, the speaking is probably the biggest. That's where we get the most impact is having like people on stage or in a conference like really laying it all out there. Generally, we get an in as a kind of sponsor as well, which works really well in our favor. So after we're done speaking, you generally find us in the sponsors area at our table, which gives people a chance like if they didn't want to come up to us, right when we're done talking, because they're afraid of people seeing them or something like that. Like that's another great way for us to outreach as well. Um, I would say like conferences are, conferences are probably our biggest way to get the word out. The books are great, the surveys good. A few of us are pretty active on Twitter as well. But the conferences are generally where most of our outreach comes from.

Rahat Chowdhury  9:18  
Awesome. Um, you guys mentioned like the books. There were like three books that were put out. How was the idea around those books kind of conceived. And did you guys contribute to those in any way?

Matt Trask  9:34  
I definitely didn't contribute to them. No. And that's good, because I don't really understand English all that well. So, like, we don't really want me editing books. But like, the main thing is, is when we're starting when Ed and Joe really getting this thing going, they're trying to look at quick, impactful ways to get the word out there. That, OSMI was a thing and here's our mission. And one thing that they realized really fast Is that there really is no literature around. As someone who deals with a mental illness, what are your rights and protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act? That kind of brings up an interesting point because like we're an American founding company, while we do have representation in Europe in other places, like our stuff is mainly focused on American culture right now. Because you know, our healthcare system is just so great. And so the books just kind of came out as like a quick way for us to get the word out there. And also just, it's a it's a really easy way for people to get help without having to volunteer that information, which is something we realize quickly on as well is it's really hard to talk about this stuff, even to your friends and your family. And so, downloading a book is a quick anonymous way to kind of realize what you can get help with without having to out yourself as a Someone who is manic or has bipolar disorder or something like that. Like JD said they're on lean pub, and they've been vetted and work through with actual psychologists and people with medical degrees. So we didn't just write these and say they're good to go, we had them 100% checked for accuracy, make sure that everything is copacetic. under, under the current laws, um, if you go to lean pub, you can take it down to free, but if you give us some cash then so we get to go to conferences, so kinda put a little, some there.

J.D. Flynn  11:37  
And in addition to Pshycologist review it was also reviewed by a lawyer who specializes in the ADA, I believe, um, we we've got a lot of great people who volunteer a lot of their very, very valuable time. And just the fact that they're as passionate about this as we are is amazing. So, yeah, we're not just making words, for the sake of making words, we're making words that actually have some basis in reality.

Rahat Chowdhury  12:09  
That's awesome. Yeah. So how did the two of you kind of get involved with volunteering? And like if someone is kind of interested in becoming a volunteer, how does how does one go about doing that?

J.D. Flynn  12:21  
So my path to joining was a rocky road, but it led to a really, really good outcome. Um, and I'm sure that my story is pretty similar to a lot of our volunteers. So I'm local to the Chicago area. And I was dealing with, like the first stages of admitting to myself that I have a mental illness. I've got depression, I've got PTSD, ADHD. And I saw that there was a PHP meetup and the topic happened to be about mental illness. The speaker was Ed Finkler. And I went, I attended this talk. And it absolutely blew my mind. I'm, like Matt said earlier, the American healthcare system is so great. I was, at the time that I saw the talk, I was kind of in the weird period where I had found a therapist, I'd started getting treatment, the therapist said, Hey, you need to get on medication. But I can't prescribe it. So go see your doctor. And I didn't have a doctor. So I found one. And it was a, I believe, three month wait before I could get my first visit. So I had that weird. I know I need help. I know the answers are out there. I know there's something that can help me, but I can't do anything about it until I could get into a doctor because reasons. I still don't know what they are, um, and just being in that kind of limbo, but hearing somebody speak about stuff that was really, really resonating with me things that I was going through at the exact same time it was pretty amazing. And spoke with Ed a little bit after the talk. And a couple months went by and got myself treatment decided, hey, Ed's talk literally changed my life. I would like to attempt to do something similar. So I reached out to him by email and asked, Hey, would you mind if I did a talk similar to yours? And his response was, you can take my talk, take my slides, and change the name if you want to, I don't care. Just get out and do it. He invited me to the OSMI slack. I grew a beard started wearing glasses to look more like him and I did write my own version of the talk heavily inspired by his but that was kind of my path. And then the more that I hang out in Slack, the more that I'm able to do, the more I want to do

Rahat Chowdhury  14:55  
It's interesting that you mentioned like hearing that talk with Ed I actually went on the site I had seen like a YouTube video, might be the talk that you're speaking on. I think he was at some type of Google event and talking about some of the things he goes through. And as I was kind of watching it, I went through some of the same things you're kind of mentioning and me, myself, I'm also I also go through mental illness. This episode, is like pretty special to me in that case. I've also been trying to do some talks in mental health and tech. So kind of seeing that kind of put a lot of things in perspective for me as well. So, you know, I just wanted I thought that was a good time to say thank you for what you guys are doing. But yeah, that's, that's really that's really awesome. So if anyone does want to get involved, reaching out shouldn't be an issue right? 

Matt Trask  16:00  
No, you can, you can find a lot of us on Twitter. Um, and that's a great way just to get the conversation going and then we invite you to the slack and then, um, we we keep it fairly lax in there as like, excuse me, like there's no requirements for how many talks you need to give or how many blog posts you need to do. It's, if you're more of a writer, then by all means, go see what the blog group is doing and see where you can help out. If you're a speaker, whether it's your first time speaking or your hundredth time speaking. You know, talk to the other speakers and kind of see what's worked really well for them. So it hasn't worked really well for them. And then just from there, whenever you're ready to start submitting to a conference, you know, find one of us who do it quite often and we'll help you through the whole process of submitting a talk that we know is gonna get accepted which kind of works out in our favor because people You know, they really want us to be coming to talk. So generally, we always have a way into a conference. And so if you're, if you're a first time speaker or something like that you want to get involved, like we're more than happy to kind of guide you through that process as well.

Rahat Chowdhury  17:14  
That's amazing. That's awesome. Cool. So speaking of talks, do both of you do talks, I think JD I saw that you do some Matt. Are you kind of doing that as well?

Matt Trask  17:28  
Yeah, I'm, I did a lot last year. I'm thinking this year, kind of like keeping it low key, but I gave two keynotes and a session last year around mental health on top of other tech talks as well. So that's, that's mainly like my focus as a volunteer. I like public speaking and I like doing that and I would, I don't really have much tying me down so I'm able to travel really easily. So, um, you can definitely find me out at conferences. Like I said earlier, like, you'll find this at the sponsor tables too. But like most of us are pretty comfortable kind of talking about this kind of stuff like in a non medical way too. So if you do see us at a conference, like you're more than welcome to kind of come up and talk to us and, you know, relate to us. And we'll we'll definitely be able to relate back to you as well.

Rahat Chowdhury  18:25  
That's amazing. Cool. Great. So, I guess kind of like doing these talks and working with OSMI a little bit. Do you guys have any ideas for like what important things employers and professionals can do to make tech a more inviting place for people who like suffer through mental illness?

Matt Trask  18:48  
I mean, that's, that's the million dollar question. Like, Tech has enough problems as it is to figure out I mean, like, from my point of view, you know, like, the biggest thing is like, be open and caring. And if you're gonna, like, say that you're opening, caring, then be willing to back it up. A great example is when I was interviewing for my last job back over the summer, the company I currently work for when I talk to the HR and who would be like the kind of like the non tech lead of the team, I'm on. They both said, the mental health of our employees is really special, and we care about it. And we really try and do our best to make sure that our teams are taking time for themselves and all kinds of things like, Oh, that's great. I speak on mental health, and I volunteer for an organization and they're like, oh, that, you know, that's really amazing that you do that. We we really think that that's, like, we want to encourage you to keep doing that. I was like, that's great. That's awesome. But you know, I'm gonna hold you to your word. And make sure Like you don't screw this one up and a couple of weeks ago like I was basically heads down on a feature and worked myself sick just like from a cold and the weather changing so rapidly. But once I handed it off the very next thing my boss messaged me was, you're taking these next three days off or whatever it was, and you're not getting on Slack, you're not coding, you're gonna go do whatever else you want to do, but you're not going to be working. We want to make sure you get some time to relax, and to kind of recharge yourself and so like, if you're gonna if you're gonna espouse these hole we care about mental health and we want you to take care of yourself and when it when it comes time for your employees to say hey, I need time for myself. You know, own it, give it to them, no questions asked and make sure that they are constantly taking that time to recharge and not not be working themselves morning to night.

J.D. Flynn  21:02  
Yeah, I think that also, if if a company recognizes or if somebody in a leadership position recognizes that, hey, maybe we're not doing the best job we can and they start making some efforts to that. I think I don't know about you, Matt. But uh, for myself personally, I think that kind of in a unique position where, you know, if somebody were to Google my name, first things that are going to pop up, aside from hopefully my personal website are going to be you know, my talks that have been recorded on mental illness and me basically saying to the world, hey, I have mental illness. So for people on one of the biggest questions I asked is, how how do you deal with talking to a potential employer about mental illness and I really can't answer that because, you know, any good potential employer is going to Google me and know everything about me to begin with. But about a year ago, I was, well, I year and a half ago, I did a talk at one of the Drupal camps, which are regional Drupal conferences. And turns out that the CEO of one of the larger Drupal companies was sitting in on it. And I found out six months after the fact that he took back from my talk and went to his company and said, Hey, there is a hole that we need to fill on. Let's get a couple of people here together, find out where holes are on what we can do to make this a more welcoming company and what changes we need to make and so they formed you know, an internal group. From what I understand they did very similar to the OSMI survey, they made their own internal version of sending out anonymously to all the employees found out what the company's lacking and then start making small change. And I was extremely humbled and just impressed. A huge company that I've looked up to. He did a huge turnaround just based on listening to me blabber on for about 45 minutes. So, if, and I think that's one of the hardest things, too is, I don't know about you, Matt. But a lot of the talks I go to I'm talking to people who look like me or who are at the same level employment wise as me on and not usually the HR professionals or the, the the senior leadership who can actually implement those changes. So I think getting that senior leadership to understand that there is an issue and get out to talks like these or at least watch the videos or buy the handbooks on lean pub. All that that would be one of the biggest things that can lead to a change.

Matt Trask  23:57  
Yeah, I mean, that's that's a good point that you bring out I'm trying to think back of like the talks I did, where most of the people were bearded and kind of chubby like me. I think there's a little bit of leadership in some of them, but for the most part, it was, is definitely more like senior developers, which we can't really change a whole lot of. Um, so you know, like sending getting this information to HR is definitely the way to do it. Being proactive and trying to understand it as well. Like JD said, you know, although I did just google me like right now because I was actually curious. None of my like, none of my talks come up, because I don't ever get videotaped. No one ever wants to videotape me, which is not the worst thing ever. But like, if you dig deep enough in you can figure out that I speak about mental illness. And I talk about it pretty openly on Twitter and all that kind of stuff too. And like I know when I was when I was interviewing last time, the CEO, the company, I work at he looked at my Twitter, my blog and I was like, he's like, you know, you're really gonna fit in here. And I'm like, so you're saying we're all dumpster fire just company because that's pretty much right. But like, you know, like, there's no question about like I I hang out and I deal with these things and I do this and I speak and I talk and I, I volunteer for a group of people with mental illnesses and things like that. So I never really have to deal with that whole How do I tell people I do this kind of thing. But I have had to help people do that when at the last key or one of the last keynotes I did. A person sent me this whole email about his boss was in the same conference. They were sitting side by side listening to me give my talk and he'd how he, he didn't know how to tell his boss, I'm sitting right next to him like, Hey, this is pretty much everything that the guy on stage is talking about. I'm going through the exact same things. And so he was he was kind Like, wishing and hoping that my words would have an impact on his boss, and I was like, well, I totally get that, and I hope it does. But this is kind of like where OSMI's motto comes in, which is stronger than fear. And if you want to make a change, you've got to kind of like step up to the plate and take a swing. Um, conferences are hit or miss, like a lot of people are sitting in Keynote talks, they're on their phones or on their iPads or on their laptops, they're tweeting, they're talking, you know, not everyone is 100% engaging, although I do like to think of myself as an engaging individual. You know, people are gonna zone out people aren't gonna, like, totally get the message. And so I tell them, like, I hope my message works, here's some questions you can have that will kind of let you poke and prod without outing yourself. But if you truly want to See change, you're gonna have to take a really big leap. And I know that's not easy. And I know it's gonna take a lot for you. But I promise you, it gets easier once you make that first leap. And so, you know, like, if you're someone who's who's dealing with these things, like, if you don't know where to start, like find our talks on YouTube JD talks. Ed's talk at Google is probably one of the easiest ones to digest. Find us on Twitter, get our books, and, you know, anonymously, email them use like mailinator, whatever. And honestly, email them to your HR and be like, Hey, I'm gonna play you here. I'm not gonna help myself. But I think y'all need to read these and I think these be a company wide thing. Um, and the other thing too, one thing is that if you think your company would benefit from from it, a lot of times we will, we will talk to companies as well as conferences. It's definitely not something we advertise it's it's definitely on like a per case basis. But if you feel that, like if you've seen us talk you've seen the like the impact we've had elsewhere and you think it would help your company, you're more than welcome to approach one of us and say, we would love to have one of your speakers, whether it's like something like this remotely, and we're just on a Google Hangouts or work something out with OSMI, me to fly us to your headquarters to do it in person, where we will, we will take the onus of the whole talking about the heavy subjects while hopefully getting to influencing more than just the software team. So you know, there's there's a lot of different ways that these various can start getting broken down from super simple to Super drastic.

J.D. Flynn  28:52  
And to kind of piggyback off of that, for for anybody who is going through the first time I guess the appropriate term is disclosing a disability. Or saying, Hey, I'm going through this thing. If the company that you're with when you disclose that doesn't react in a way that is really conducive to being a welcoming workplace, then maybe it's good that you find it out earlier rather than later, because now you can start potentially planning your exit strategy, and just have a better feel for hey, these are the people I'm working for. Maybe it's maybe I'm not the best fit, or maybe they're not the best fit for me would probably be a better look for it.

Rahat Chowdhury  29:38  
Absolutely. Awesome. So while I was looking into you guys a little bit on the OSMI site, Matt, I noticed you also you mentioned it's mentioned there that you mentor and help developers grow. Do you feel like some of your work with OSMI has helped kind of with your mentorship

Matt Trask  30:00  
I mean, I definitely think it's helped. Yeah, the whole reason I got involved in OSMI is because a guy who mentored me, Joe Ferguson was involved. And I was like, Well, if you're doing it, I think it's a great idea. So I'll do it too. And so that's kind of like how I got involved in terms of like mentorship within OSMI. You know, like, I've definitely helped speakers kind of get more comfortable speaking, which is not something that's innate to a lot of us, like public speaking is a huge fear to a lot of different people. You know, like, like, at first, like, a first few of my talks, like I did, mildly, not sober because I was like, I don't know how to do this. And so I would just kind of like drink in the corner and then give talks and I figured out how to be an adult and get over that. But so like, every so often, we'll get someone joining the slack and they're like, you know, I'm a new speaker. Like, can I borrow someone's slides and stuff. I'll send them a one of my slide decks and then kind of guide them through how to create an engaging story with slides and stories and things like that. And so while like, my, like the main mentorship that I do is like helping junior developers grow it make it readily available to them that this is also an aspect of my life. And if this is something that you deal with, as well, you know, you're more than welcome to bring this up. And we can also kind of talk through being a developer and also dealing with like anxiety and think you're gonna get fired at every step of your life, which is something I spent a good year of my life working through. So it's definitely there but it's for OSMI it's more or less me speaking and getting the message out mentoring second, whereas, otherwise, mentoring comes first for me.

Rahat Chowdhury  31:56  
Gotcha. Awesome. Um, so Going into OSMI a little bit more. I noticed there's like a list of resources on the OSMI site. A few apps and a few things like that help out with mental health in general. Are there any resources aren't there that you guys particularly like, or find particularly helpful in any way?

J.D. Flynn  32:25  
Of course the books available on lean pub. Um, so DRM free, if you were to buy copies, you can distribute them to everybody you work with. Some Mental Health First Aid is a huge one. I think that anybody in any type of leadership position, all should have that. And it's not necessarily, you know, treating or diagnosing on scene. It's more recognizing and seeing symptoms in you know, understanding what may happen? So I don't know if it's anywhere on any of my BIOS I spent before my development career, I spent about 10 years working as a paramedic. So the mental health ties into it pretty tightly and it's something very near and dear to my heart. You know, Joe has an anecdote that he tells where he because of his mental health first aid training, he recognized that one of his employees, somebody on his team was working their butts off just putting in a lot of extra hours. And because of that, he recognized Hey, this person might be prone to burnout, maybe, maybe we're putting too much on them, and not not in a bad way. Just, you know, oh, we're just handing more and they're afraid to say no. Right and they should just recognizing that and taking a step back and saying, Hey, are you all right? Is everything okay? are we are we giving you enough? You time you don't feel that we're expecting too much of you are we? And I think that's great from being in a leadership position to have that resource to be able to say, ah, maybe we're doing something wrong and not blaming the employee. Ah, there's a lot of other great stuff on there. I'm I'm scrolling through right now because there's so much but just anything to help you find help if you need it, or help you find knowledge if you need it.

Rahat Chowdhury  34:48  
Awesome. Great. Um, so you spoke a little bit about the forum's before. Can you tell us a little bit about how those work

Unknown Speaker  35:00  
It it's kind of like an anonymous place where if somebody is having issue come to the forums, and maybe ask a question, you know, no, no judgement about any questions. And if somebody puts something that's particularly troubling some of our volunteers monitor them pretty closely, and we'll get a ping in slack. Hey, does anybody have time to look into this or respond to this? Reach out to this person? So we we do make efforts to kind of make sure that nobody's coming on they're in crisis, and if they are, we direct them to where they actually should be. But um, before it was the OSMI forums, it was brought up to me quite a bit and when I would talk about this in various slack teams about hey, I'm going through stuff. Somebody would always post a link to devpress.com which is now OSMI forums. And so knowing that it's well known and that developers feel safe going to it, I think it's pretty awesome. Yeah. And also having a, an anonymous venting area. But for anybody who may be listening, if you are in crisis, don't go to the forums seek help.

Rahat Chowdhury  36:23  
Absolutely. We'd like to wrap up our episodes by having like a little bit of a catch up session. So what are some of your guys kind of interests or hobbies, stuff you like to do outside of OSMI or your regular work?

J.D. Flynn  36:37  
Wait there there's life outside of OSMI?

Matt Trask  36:40  
This is news to me.

J.D. Flynn  36:45  
Honestly, I am a musician in my free time I play baritone sax in a community, Wind Ensemble. I have been learning a lot of non PHP stuff lately. GatsbyJS has been a lot of fun to kind of dive into, but really my my heart is in speaking and attending these events where I can represent OSMI and you know because for one it's fun to get to these places and see people and two being there and being a voice for people who may not have the, I can't think of the word for it but may not want to get up and say these things or they may not want to go to their bosses and admit things that that's probably you know, the biggest thing they enjoy you enjoy doing that. That isn't work.

Rahat Chowdhury  37:50  
That's amazing. That's awesome.

Matt Trask  37:52  
Yeah, outside of work.I don't really know what happens outside of work, to be honest. I do Do a lot of cycling in my free time I give like bike tours of downtown Nashville, but I also race with a team as well. So I'm generally like, if I'm not coding, I'm on a fight, whether it's like inside or outside. Um, I also do a lot of photography. It used to be a musician and then I realized I needed money. So that's how I became a developer. So I need health insurance, because then awesome American, but I got my guitars laying around here and I'll play them. But so yeah, like outside of work. Because like, it's my personality that like deep dive and like basically, like, just if I want to learn something I want like I will put my entire life into learning it and so um, that's both a really good thing and a really bad thing because it gets obsessive after a while and if it's on the computer, then I'm just gonna hold myself up and like my room and not ever come out and see the light of day so I really try and make sure I have hobbies that day. require a computer. So like photography, cycling, reading, being like a little whiskey snob, that kind of stuff, things that get me outside and away from the computer like my, my biggest things right now as well as like chasing financial independence and trying to retire. So I can, like just do open source stuff for the rest of my life and not have to worry about a paycheck.

Rahat Chowdhury  39:26  
That would be amazing. Yeah.

Matt Trask  39:28  
It would be, someone on dev to like, tried to psychoanalyze me because I said, I didn't want to keep coding for the rest of my life. And I was like, You don't know me, A. B. It's okay to like, not want to code for the rest of your life.

Rahat Chowdhury  39:40  
Right It's interesting that you both mentioned being musicians. I'm also a former musician. I feel like that's super common among people who come into technology, as far as I've seen. I used to actually be a hip hop artist. But yeah, like you mentioned, Matt, I need to make money. So

Matt Trask  39:59  
It's very common here because I live in Nashville which you know is like Music City of America or whatever. And like you go to a meet up. And we have a really great boot camp here called the Nashville software school, they do a really great job. And every so often I'll go speak and kind of do like a developer asked me anything or like, here's what life as a senior developer is, kind of thing. And, like one of the things I've noticed is like third, like three quarters of the classroom are musicians in some respects. Some of them have degrees in theory, some of them have degrees in production, some of them have music careers, but you know, they need something a little bit more steady. And so like, you can't throw a rock in a developer meetup here in Nashville and not hit a musician like, like Nash j. s is tonight and I guarantee if I went there, I'd be like, you're a musician, you're a musician. You're it's really funny how those two things kind of work out.
